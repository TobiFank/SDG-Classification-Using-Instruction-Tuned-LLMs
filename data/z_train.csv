1,"“Investors are good, if they follow the rules” – power relations and local perceptions in the case of two European forestry companies in Tanzania
The rapidly increasing interest of foreign investors in land in the global South, also termed land grabbing, has been widely discussed as potentially supportive, but often rather harmful for local populations. Combining a critical livelihoods perspective with access theory and a bargaining model, this study scrutinizes local people’s perceptions of the land investments, power relations during land negotiations and intra-community differences. By analysing two European forestry companies in Tanzania, we have chosen a sector and a country with presumably more positive outcomes for local populations. The deals resulted in not only labour opportu- nities and infrastructural improvements, which are mainly perceived as positive, but also cases of violated land rights, inadequate compensation and decreased food security. Hence, even under favourable preconditions, the consequences for local people are ambivalent. With this study, we contribute to a differentiated analysis of the contested role of large-scale land deals in contemporary rural development.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:102805,0.849141538143158,0.8796160221099854,0.0130561413243412,0.0018490665825083,0.0028822715394198,0.0162881463766098,0.0021753262262791,0.936825156211853,0.1865292489528656,0.1746523678302765,0.4752107858657837,0.4059319198131561,0.0036775025073438,0.0076030013151466,0.973724603652954,0.705896258354187,0.7260907292366028,No Poverty,Aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.
1,"Negotiating access to land in Nepal
In a rural agrarian economy like that of Nepal, land has traditionally been a primary source of livelihood and security, as well as a symbol of status. Thousands of poor farmers are completely dependent on land for their livelihoods, yet not all of them have access to or control over this fundamental resource. Negotiation for access to land has been a lengthy and complicated process. It remains so in the changed political context of Nepal, where increasing numbers of emerging actors need to be considered, often with conflicting claims and counterclaims. In this context the traditional ways of thinking need to be revised, both with regard to the negotiating process and the mechanisms of land reform, to accommodate the country’s recent and ongoing massive socio-economic transformation.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:88401,0.9949021339416504,0.979719340801239,0.0181387793272733,0.0022713998332619,0.0079072127118706,0.0107783786952495,0.002378576202318,0.7854416370391846,0.1786508411169052,0.2043867111206054,0.4243540167808532,0.4993232190608978,0.0813750252127647,0.0028841728344559,0.7402703762054443,0.4232771396636963,0.3921799659729004,No Poverty,Aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.

2,"The evolution of daily food sharing: A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis
Some human subsistence economies are characterized by extensive daily food sharing networks, which may buffer the risk of shortfalls and facilitate cooperative production and divisions of labor among households. Comparative studies of human food sharing can assess the generalizability of this theory across time, space, and diverse lifeways. Here we test several predictions about daily sharing norms–which presumably reflect realized cooperative behavior–in a globally representative sample of nonindustrial societies (the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample), while controlling for multiple sources of autocorrelation among societies using Bayesian multilevel models. Consistent with a risk-buffering function, we find that sharing is less likely in societies with alternative means of smoothing production and consumption such as animal husbandry, food storage, and external trade. Further, food sharing was tightly linked to labor sharing, indicating gains to cooperative production and perhaps divisions of labor. We found a small phylogenetic signal for food sharing (captured by a supertree of human populations based on genetic and linguistic data) that was mediated by food storage and social stratification. Food sharing norms reliably emerge as part of cooperative economies across time and space but are culled by innovations that facilitate self-reliant production.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170833,0.1619848608970642,0.9728565216064452,0.0142674408853054,0.0370677486062049,0.0021273477468639,0.0020796719472855,0.0021347173023968,0.9803974628448486,0.8781377077102661,0.5346062779426575,0.1246038749814033,0.934779167175293,0.0046026394702494,0.0087819136679172,0.0368022099137306,0.0029067639261484,0.9822694659233092,Zero Hunger,"Aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."
2,"A chromosome-scale genome assembly reveals a highly dynamic effector repertoire of wheat powdery mildew
Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (B.g. tritici) is the causal agent of the wheat powdery mildew disease. The highly fragmented B.g. tritici genome available so far has prevented a systematic analysis of effector genes that are known to be involved in host adaptation. To study the diversity and evolution of effector genes we produced a chromosome‐scale assembly of the B.g. tritici genome.  The genome assembly and annotation was achieved by combining long‐read sequencing with high‐density genetic mapping, bacterial artificial chromosome fingerprinting and transcriptomics. We found that the 166.6 Mb B.g. tritici genome encodes 844 candidate effector genes, over 40% more than previously reported. Candidate effector genes have characteristic local genomic organization such as gene clustering and enrichment for recombination‐active regions and certain transposable element families. A large group of 412 candidate effector genes shows high plasticity in terms of copy number variation in a global set of 36 isolates and of transcription levels.  Our data suggest that copy number variation and transcriptional flexibility are the main drivers for adaptation in B.g. tritici. The high repeat content may play a role in providing a genomic environment that allows rapid evolution of effector genes with selection as the driving force.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:160633,0.0039054520893841,0.910661518573761,0.1897193938493728,0.0016483236104249,0.0019041624618694,0.582697868347168,0.0124387005344033,0.0097609655931591,0.0178998429328203,0.0167630221694707,0.0168701875954866,0.8426403999328613,0.0040913638658821,0.0764701440930366,0.9357577562332152,0.0030137114226818,0.0100781051442027,Zero Hunger,"Aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."
2,"Field grown transgenic Pm3e wheat lines show powdery mildew resistance and no fitness costs associated with high transgene expression
Pm3 from wheat encodes a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat type of receptor and confers resistance to powdery mildew caused by the fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt). Each of the 17 functional Pm3 alleles identified so far confers resistance to a distinct spectrum of Bgt isolates. Variant Pm3e has been found in wheat donor line W150 and differs only by two amino acids from the non-functional variant Pm3CS. In order to evaluate the capability of Pm3e to provide powdery mildew field resistance, we generated transgenic Pm3e lines by biolistic transformation of the powdery mildew susceptible spring wheat cultivar Bobwhite. Field trials conducted during four field seasons in Switzerland showed significant and strong powdery mildew resistance of the Pm3e transgenic lines, whereas the corresponding biological sister lines, not containing the transgene, were severely powdery mildew infected. Thus Pm3e alone is responsible for the strong resistance phenotype. The field grown transgenic lines showed high transgene expression and Pm3e protein accumulation with no fitness costs on plant development and yield associated with Pm3e abundance. Line E#1 as well as sister line E#1 showed delayed flowering due to somaclonal variation. The study shows the capability of Pm3e in providing strong powdery mildew field resistance, making its use in wheat breeding programs very promising.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:160634,0.0039387955330312,0.917519748210907,0.006397986318916,0.0016303895972669,0.0018063929164782,0.2859750986099243,0.0032181527931243,0.0053580990061163,0.150112971663475,0.0088191702961921,0.0126686533913016,0.9000473022460938,0.0049346992745995,0.0416327379643917,0.6337661147117615,0.0031195029150694,0.298166275024414,Zero Hunger,"Aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."

2,"Improvement of soil structure through organic crop management, conservation tillage and grass-clover ley
Conventional tillage is a widespread soil management practice that controls weeds and promotes nutrient mineralization at the expense of a degraded soil structure and soil carbon (C) loss. Although C dynamics and soil structure are widely recognized as pivotal to essential environmental and crop-related agroecosystem processes such as belowground C storage and crop root establishment, there is still a need to evaluate cropping practices most favorable for soil structure. For example, the effects on soil structure by continuous intensive tillage after a ley period remains unclear. To address these issues, we measured mean weight diameter, total C and total nitrogen (N) in whole soil and water-stable aggregate fractions after a 4-year arable crop rotation on a Cambisol where organic and conventional management was combined with intensive tillage and different types of conservation tillage. Measurements were repeated following a 2-year grass-clover ley period. Results showed that 4 years of organic management (including the application of cattle manure slurry) combined with reduced tillage significantly improved soil structure through increasing the proportion of large macroaggregates and hence the aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) in the 0-6 cm soil layer. Although an increase in MWD after ley was observed in organic intensive tillage and a marginal increase in conventional intensive tillage, a significant increase in total C was observed only for the organic cropping systems, which also showed a high C stratification between 0-6 cm and 6-20 cm depth. Thus, a ley period enhances soil structure after continuous cropping under intensive tillage and when organic management is combined with reduced tillage. In conclusion, soil structure is best maintained when combining organic management with reduced tillage due to additive effects.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168382,0.0042392797768116,0.9803566336631776,0.0122473891824483,0.0019726566970348,0.0024074350949376,0.9187111258506776,0.0021651107817888,0.0058820354752242,0.0101238153874874,0.0035711042582988,0.0296306740492582,0.7660803198814392,0.0038287499919533,0.0371450819075107,0.9566746950149536,0.0029181824065744,0.0090142413973808,Zero Hunger,"Aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."
2,"Cropping practices manipulate abundance patterns of root and soil microbiome members paving the way to smart farming
Background Harnessing beneficial microbes presents a promising strategy to optimize plant growth and agricultural sustainability. Little is known to which extent and how specifically soil and plant microbiomes can be manipulated through different cropping practices. Here, we investigated soil and wheat root microbial communities in a cropping system experiment consisting of conventional and organic managements, both with different tillage intensities.
Results While microbial richness was marginally affected, we found pronounced cropping effects on community composition, which were specific for the respective microbiomes. Soil bacterial communities were primarily structured by tillage, whereas soil fungal communities responded mainly to management type with additional effects by tillage. In roots, management type was also the driving factor for bacteria but not for fungi, which were generally determined by changes in tillage intensity. To quantify an “effect size” for microbiota manipulation, we found that about 10% of variation in microbial communities was explained by the tested cropping practices. Cropping sensitive microbes were taxonomically diverse, and they responded in guilds of taxa to the specific practices. These microbes also included frequent community members or members co-occurring with many other microbes in the community, suggesting that cropping practices may allow manipulation of influential community members.
Conclusions Understanding the abundance patterns of cropping sensitive microbes presents the basis towards developing microbiota management strategies for smart farming. For future targeted microbiota management—e.g., to foster certain microbes with specific agricultural practices—a next step will be to identify the functional traits of the cropping sensitive microbes.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168385,0.004235082771629,0.9918255805969238,0.0326859466731548,0.0017427564598619,0.0020112481433898,0.1024849936366081,0.0022147262934595,0.0081809693947434,0.2174162417650222,0.0040291314944624,0.0360450781881809,0.8481078147888184,0.0042636725120246,0.018569067120552,0.9840089082717896,0.0029559542890638,0.5175185203552246,Zero Hunger,"Aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."
2,"Impact of organic and conventional farming systems on wheat grain uptake and soil bioavailability of zinc and cadmium
Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a widespread problem in human nutrition and wheat grains are a major source of Zn intake in large parts of the human population. It remains unclear to what extent organic and conventional farming practices, differing in organic matter management, influence Zn availability and uptake by wheat grains. Factors leading to an increased Zn uptake may also increase the Cd uptake in wheat grains, which are a major source of harmful Cd for humans. In this study, we investigated the effects of different farming practices on Zn and Cd concentrations in wheat grains and their relationships with total and available soil Zn and Cd concentrations, and other soil properties. In northern Switzerland, 28 farms were sampled including 11 organic farms with compost use, 10 organic farms without compost use, and 7 conventional farms without compost use. Soil organic matter was a key factor for soil Zn and especially Cd concentrations across all three farming systems. Total and available soil Cd concentrations as well as soil organic carbon concentration (SOC) were significantly higher on the organic farms with compost use than on the conventional farms. However, only the compost farms with livestock showed significantly higher grain Cd concentrations in comparison to conventional farming, whereas the organic farms without compost use were in between. In contrast to Cd, the soil and grain Zn concentrations showed no significant farming system effect although there was a correlation between total soil Zn and SOC when all farms of the survey were pooled. Grain Zn was decoupled from soil Zn indicating that under agricultural field conditions the farming systems are a minor factor in increasing grain Zn. Our study suggests that the Zn and Cd soil and grain concentrations on farms were mediated by a combination of on-farm organic matter management, soil properties, and livestock production intensity.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168376,0.0043444028124213,0.9875276684761048,0.0119968671351671,0.0016723106382414,0.0020177748519927,0.0165702626109123,0.4189281761646271,0.0170987844467163,0.1292666494846344,0.0049807853065431,0.0639550015330314,0.840405285358429,0.0040311319753527,0.0205826424062252,0.7350488305091858,0.0029589377809315,0.0091046579182147,Zero Hunger,"Aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."
2,"Root exudate metabolites drive plant-soil feedbacks on growth and defense by shaping the rhizosphere microbiota
By changing soil properties, plants can modify their growth environment. Although the soil microbiota is known to play a key role in the resulting plant-soil feedbacks, the proximal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown. We found that benzoxazinoids, a class of defensive secondary metabolites that are released by roots of cereals such as wheat and maize, alter root-associated fungal and bacterial communities, decrease plant growth, increase jasmonate signaling and plant defenses, and suppress herbivore performance in the next plant generation. Complementation experiments demonstrate that the benzoxazinoid breakdown product 6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2-one (MBOA), which accumulates in the soil during the conditioning phase, is both sufficient and necessary to trigger the observed phenotypic changes. Sterilization, fungal and bacterial profiling and complementation experiments reveal that MBOA acts indirectly by altering root-associated microbiota. Our results reveal a mechanism by which plants determine the composition of rhizosphere microbiota, plant performance and plant-herbivore interactions of the next generation.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168377,0.0039344462566077,0.9737192392349244,0.0284463707357645,0.0019286099122837,0.0020032972097396,0.3383945822715759,0.0413072071969509,0.0049443929456174,0.0099890055134892,0.0058157835155725,0.0345141217112541,0.8448331952095032,0.0050105289556086,0.0640308335423469,0.967544972896576,0.0029451991431415,0.0091801127418875,Zero Hunger,"Aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."
2,"Enterotoxin production of Bacillus thuringiensis isolates from biopesticides, foods, and outbreaks
While the relevance of Bacillus (B.) cereus as a major cause of gastroenteritis is undisputed, the role of the closely related B. thuringiensis in foodborne disease is unclear. B. thuringiensis strains frequently harbor enterotoxin genes. However, the organism has only very rarely been associated with foodborne outbreaks, possibly due to the fact that during outbreak investigations, B. cereus is routinely not differentiated from B. thuringiensis. A recent EFSA scientific opinion stresses the urgent need for further data allowing for improved risk assessment, in particular as B. thuringiensis is a commonly used biopesticide. Therefore, the aim of this study was to gain further insights into the hazardous potential of B. thuringiensis. To this end, 39 B. thuringiensis isolates obtained from commercially used biopesticides, various food sources, as well as from foodborne outbreaks were characterized by panC typing, panC-based SplitsTree analysis, toxin gene profiling, FTIR spectroscopic analysis, a cytotoxicity assay screening for enterotoxic activity, and a sphingomyelinase assay. The majority of the tested B. thuringiensis isolates exhibited low (23%, n = 9) or mid level enterotoxicity (74%, n = 29), and produced either no (59%, n = 23) or low levels (33%, n = 13) of sphingomyelinase, which is reported to act synergistically with enterotoxins Nhe and Hbl. One strain isolated from rosemary was however classified as highly enterotoxic surpassing the cytotoxic activity of the high-level reference strain by a factor of 1.5. This strain also produced vast amounts of sphingomyelinase. Combining all results obtained in this study into a fingerprint pattern, several enterotoxic biopesticide strains were indistinguishable from those of isolates from foods or collected in association with outbreaks. Our study shows that many B. thuringiensis biopesticide strains exhibit mid-level cytotoxicity in a Vero cell assay and that some of these strains cannot be differentiated from isolates collected from foods or in association with outbreaks. Thus, we demonstrate that the use of B. thuringiensis strains as biopesticides can represent a food safety risk, underpinning the importance of assessing the hazardous potential of each strain and formulation used.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168066,0.0040934314019978,0.9494654536247252,0.9203452467918396,0.0015614051371812,0.0019507292890921,0.0595152378082275,0.3781212568283081,0.005517765879631,0.0837053954601287,0.0164391752332448,0.0483683757483959,0.9659098982810974,0.0050784680061042,0.9133123755455016,0.0325636342167854,0.0029605969320982,0.0093234619125723,Zero Hunger,"Aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."
2,"Long-term Investment Choices for Quinoa Farmers in Puno, Peru: A Real Options Case Study
The goal of this article is to assess the optimal choices of a smallholder quinoa farmer in the Puno region of Peru, in terms of his decision if and when to undertake certain investments that are expected to increase quinoa yield and crop resistance to harsh weather conditions, such as frost. We focus on two irreversible options, namely quinoa variety management andWaruWaru. The former alternative considers the option of the farmer to switch from his business-as-usual quinoa variety to one that has different yield and frost resistance characteristics. The latter alternative refers to the implementation of an ancestral cultivation practice that is estimated to offer benefits in terms of yield increase and resistance to harsh climate conditions.
We rely on Real Options Analysis to assess the two types of investment opportunities for the farmer. This approach allows us to determine not only whether the investments should be undertaken or not, but also the optimal timing to do so. We find that one quinoa variety (Kancolla) offers the highest benefits to the farmer and switching to this option should be immediate if investment costs are low; however, as costs increase, the decision to switch quinoa variety is optimally postponed until quinoa price uncertainty is reduced. We find that the Waru Waru option is not worth undertaking unless further evidence related to the increase in the productivity of quinoa is developed. However, at increases in productivity above 20%, the Waru Waru option becomes highly attractive. The article also discusses how quinoa price dynamics, yield sensitivity to frost, and governmental support impact decisions of the smallholder farmer.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157456,0.0042930012568831,0.9540080428123474,0.0111296670511364,0.0017383155645802,0.0020573029760271,0.0086490372195839,0.032693650573492,0.9613715410232544,0.7903131246566772,0.069421000778675,0.0320052094757556,0.4547420144081116,0.9927710890769958,0.0096937762573361,0.530267059803009,0.8431167602539062,0.9508146643638612,Zero Hunger,"Aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."
3,"Transmaternal Helicobacter pylori exposure reduces allergic airway inflammation in offspring through regulatory T cells
BACKGROUND  Transmaternal exposure to tobacco, microbes, nutrients, and other environmental factors shapes the fetal immune system through epigenetic processes. The gastric microbe Helicobacter pylori represents an ancestral constituent of the human microbiota that causes gastric disorders on the one hand and is inversely associated with allergies and chronic inflammatory conditions on the other.  OBJECTIVE  Here we investigate the consequences of transmaternal exposure to H pylori in utero and/or during lactation for susceptibility to viral and bacterial infection, predisposition to allergic airway inflammation, and development of immune cell populations in the lungs and lymphoid organs.  METHODS  We use experimental models of house dust mite- or ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation and influenza A virus or Citrobacter rodentium infection along with metagenomics analyses, multicolor flow cytometry, and bisulfite pyrosequencing, to study the effects of H pylori on allergy severity and immunologic and microbiome correlates thereof.  RESULTS  Perinatal exposure to H pylori extract or its immunomodulator vacuolating cytotoxin confers robust protective effects against allergic airway inflammation not only in first- but also second-generation offspring but does not increase susceptibility to viral or bacterial infection. Immune correlates of allergy protection include skewing of regulatory over effector T cells, expansion of regulatory T-cell subsets expressing CXCR3 or retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt, and demethylation of the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) locus. The composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota is measurably affected by perinatal H pylori exposure.  CONCLUSION  We conclude that exposure to H pylori has consequences not only for the carrier but also for subsequent generations that can be exploited for interventional purposes.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157671,0.0040037147700786,0.5092456936836243,0.995515525341034,0.0017009135335683,0.0022806418128311,0.834058940410614,0.0371345691382885,0.0053706266917288,0.0105011891573667,0.0155658237636089,0.0149833420291543,0.4322018921375274,0.0056289518252015,0.0383087322115898,0.3139970302581787,0.003080625552684,0.0093125896528363,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Microbes and asthma: Opportunities for intervention
The worldwide incidence and prevalence of asthma continues to increase. Asthma is now understood as an umbrella term for different phenotypes or endotypes, which arise through different pathophysiologic pathways. Understanding the many factors contributing to development of the disease is important for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of certain asthma phenotypes. The hygiene hypothesis has been formulated to explain the increasing prevalence of allergic disease, including asthma. This hypothesis postulates that decreased exposure at a young age to certain infectious agents as a result of improved hygiene, increased antibiotic use and vaccination, and changes in lifestyle and dietary habits is associated with changes in the immune system, which predispose subjects to allergy. Many microbes, during their coevolution with human subjects, developed mechanisms to manipulate the human immune system and to increase their chances of survival. Improving models of asthma, as well as choosing adequate end points in clinical trials, will lead to a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms, thus providing an opportunity to devise primary and secondary interventions at the same time as identifying new molecular targets for treatment. This article reports the discussion and conclusion of a workshop under the auspices of the Netherlands Lung Foundation to extend our understanding of how modulation of the immune system by bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections might affect the development of asthma and to map out future lines of investigation.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:124568,0.0038855692837387,0.8582773804664612,0.9981794357299804,0.0177928693592548,0.0029516865033656,0.0650785639882087,0.0024070618674159,0.0272743012756109,0.148698404431343,0.0321049652993679,0.0606411397457122,0.0085464548319578,0.0051876553334295,0.0076059843413531,0.008413259871304,0.0284972544759511,0.3450400233268738,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Assessing the Influence of Vegan, Vegetarian and Omnivore Oriented Westernized Dietary Styles on Human Gut Microbiota: A Cross Sectional Study
Diet and lifestyle have a strong influence on gut microbiota, which in turn has important implications on a variety of health-related aspects. Despite great advances in the field, it remains unclear to which extent the composition of the gut microbiota is modulated by the intake of animal derived products, compared to a vegetable based diet. Here the specific impact of vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore feeding type on the composition of gut microbiota of 101 adults was investigated among groups homogeneous for variables known to have a role in modulating gut microbial composition such as age, anthropometric variables, ethnicity, and geographic area. The results displayed a picture where the three different dietetic profiles could be well distinguished on the basis of participant’s dietetic regimen. Regarding the gut microbiota; vegetarians had a significantly greater richness compared to omnivorous. Moreover, counts of Bacteroidetes related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were greater in vegans and vegetarians compared to omnivores. Interestingly considering the whole bacterial community composition the three cohorts were unexpectedly similar, which is probably due to their common intake in terms of nutrients rather than food, e.g., high fat content and reduced protein and carbohydrate intake. This finding suggests that fundamental nutritional choices such as vegan, vegetarian, or omnivore do influence the microbiota but do not allow to infer conclusions on gut microbial composition, and suggested the possibility for a preferential impact of other variables, probably related to the general life style on shaping human gut microbial community in spite of dietary influence. Consequently, research were individuals are categorized on the basis of their claimed feeding types is of limited use for scientific studies, since it appears to be oversimplified.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:163387,0.0039036348462104,0.989047110080719,0.5804949998855591,0.0114995716139674,0.0024581628385931,0.0855251848697662,0.0019174689659848,0.0062475204467773,0.0158366039395332,0.2413920164108276,0.0559143684804439,0.8601353168487549,0.0049877045676112,0.1533141732215881,0.2738034725189209,0.0230890326201915,0.0095724873244762,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

3,"A study design for physical activity reference data collection using GPS and accelerometer
A physically active lifestyle is a key component of promoting health and well-being particularly for healthy ageing. Most sensor-based studies are focused on measuring the level (or intensity) of physical activity and use data collected using a specific study protocol under a controlled laboratory condition and are thus hardly comparable to each other and difficult to use as training or validation data for real-life studies. Therefore, it is important to have available a reference dataset for physical activity type classification especially in real-life environments. The main aim of this study is to provide a study design for collecting a reference dataset that can maximize both internal and ecological validity of measuring physical activity types. To that end, we designed study protocols in three different conditions, namely: laboratory/controlled, semi-structured and real life. To collect data, a sample of 40 healthy participants (30 younger adults and 10 older adults) will participate to perform activities including: lying, sitting, standing, walking on level ground, running, cycling, walking uphill, walking downhill, walking downstairs and walking upstairs both indoors and outdoors. The activity walking on level ground will be performed at three different speeds. Additionally, GPS and GIS methods (e.g. information about slope or dominant land use) will be used to enrich the detailed information about accelerometry-based activity types and to provide the environmental information of the place where the activities will take place. The proposed reference dataset can be useful for future validation and comparison studies and for the development of new physical activity type classifications algorithms particularly under real-life conditions.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:161051,0.0042069992050528,0.0723500251770019,0.4079342484474182,0.0015025738393887,0.0108505161479115,0.0103794010356068,0.0021600739564746,0.0127991866320371,0.0094246231019496,0.0034518335014581,0.6934300661087036,0.9394636154174804,0.0040775802917778,0.0871798694133758,0.8767188191413879,0.0028123760130256,0.0099285217002034,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

3,"Success Factors for Reducing Maternal and Child Mortality
Reducing maternal and child mortality is a priority in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and will likely remain so after 2015. Evidence exists on the investments, interventions and enabling policies required. Less is understood about why some countries achieve faster progress than other comparable countries. The Success Factors for Women’s and Children’s Health studies sought to address this knowledge gap using statistical and econometric analyses of data from 144 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) over 20 years; Boolean, qualitative comparative analysis; a literature review; and country-specific reviews in 10 fast-track countries for MDGs 4 and 5a. There is no standard formula – fast-track countries deploy tailored strategies and adapt quickly to change. However, fast-track countries share some effective approaches in addressing three main areas to reduce maternal and child mortality. First, these countries engage multiple sectors to address crucial health determinants. Around half the reduction in child mortality in LMICs since 1990 is the result of health sector investments, the other half is attributed to investments made in sectors outside health. Second, these countries use strategies to mobilize partners across society, using timely, robust evidence for decision-making and accountability and a triple planning approach to consider immediate needs, long-term vision and adaptation to change. Third, the countries establish guiding principles that orient progress, align stakeholder action and achieve results over time. This evidence synthesis contributes to global learning on accelerating improvements in women’s and children’s health towards 2015 and beyond.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:101669,0.9495946168899536,0.1361598819494247,0.9981063604354858,0.1000616997480392,0.8263293504714966,0.0021123297046869,0.0022975041065365,0.3082981407642364,0.8340273499488831,0.1275150775909423,0.0423105917870998,0.0053862556815147,0.0040052700787782,0.0024232906289398,0.0057320781052112,0.8722999095916748,0.980134904384613,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

3,"Child neglect and its relation to emotional and behavioral problems: A cross-sectional study of primary school-aged children in Tanzania
Child maltreatment is known to engender negative emotional and behavioral consequences. Although neglect is the most frequent form of maltreatment, it has thus far only received little attention, especially when looking at low-resource countries. The current study investigated possible associations between neglect and internalizing and externalizing problems. As neglect and abuse often co-occur, the latter was controlled for. In total, 409 Tanzanian primary school students (52% boys, M = 10.5 years, range = 6-15) participated in the cross-sectional study. Structured clinical interviews were conducted assessing maltreatment, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Overall, 31% (n = 128) of the children reported at least one type of physical neglect and 31% (n = 127) of emotional neglect. Using structural equation modeling, we found a significant association between neglect and internalizing (β = 0.59, p < .01) and externalizing problems (β = 0.35, p < .05). However, these associations could only be detected in younger children (ages 6-9), whereas in older children (ages 10-15), mental health problems were significantly related to violence and abuse. Our findings suggest that the current age may influence the association between maltreatment type and the development of internalizing and/or externalizing problems.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:150739,0.0117310537025332,0.1049878373742103,0.3774691224098205,0.4887447655200958,0.972612738609314,0.0045480607077479,0.0022796373814344,0.9506748914718628,0.700802206993103,0.4226035177707672,0.0237580612301826,0.3763428926467895,0.0041571795009076,0.0068636774085462,0.0061597898602485,0.9608107209205629,0.3987650275230407,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

RECENT FINDINGS: Research has found that the DSM-5 PTSD<6Y, and a similar version in the DC:0-5, currently provides the most developmentally sensitive classification of PTSD for young children. In contrast, preliminary evidence suggests that the ICD-11 criteria might not appropriately capture PTSD in young children. The inclusion of PTSD<6Y, the first developmental subtype in the DSM-5, represents an important step towards having a diagnostic system that is developmentally sensitive and relevant across the life span.

OBJECTIVE: The study of life-long consequences of severe childhood adversities or trauma has recently received much attention. However, little is known about the subjective coping success and development of positively evaluated resources that may originate within these adverse experiences and may be conceptualized as thriving. This study set out to examine the relationship between thriving in response to early adversity and successful aging with a sample of former indentured child laborers in Switzerland (Verdingkinder).

METHODS: Participants were screened according to subjective and objective health-related attributes, and those who were evaluated to be ""successful agers"" were included. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 former Verdingkinder (mean age: 71 years) that lasted 60-120 minutes. The interviews were analyzed using the paradigm model of the Grounded Theory.

RESULTS: In the interviews adverse experiences and negative consequences were reported. However, where thriving was triggered in response to these experiences, the factors identified as ""lightheartedness,"" ""social purpose,"" and ""self-enhancement"" were associated with successful aging. Factors including motivation, reflection, personality traits, social support, individual coping strategies, turning points, and processing were reported as central to thriving.

CONCLUSION: The identified factors show similarities with established predictors of health and well-being. Thus, under certain circumstances early and prolonged adverse experiences can also provide the opportunity to develop positive resources for successful aging.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:153540,0.0460320934653282,0.3275505602359772,0.4752970933914184,0.6203656792640686,0.607024073600769,0.0027503489982336,0.0022595999762415,0.9903174638748168,0.3813403248786926,0.9550467133522034,0.0252349767833948,0.0329765267670154,0.0040698456577956,0.0025448736269026,0.006161059718579,0.8688504099845886,0.0407645665109157,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Culturally shared metaphors expand contemporary concepts of resilience and post-traumatic growth: contrasting an indigenous Brazilian community and a Swiss rural community
The metaphorical concepts resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) reflect the contemporary Western understanding of overcoming highly challenging life events. However, it is known that across different cultures, a broad range of metaphorical idioms for describing adaptive responses to severe adversity exists. This study aimed to explore and contrast two distinct cultural groups’ culturally shared metaphors for overcoming severe adversities. Fieldwork was conducted in two rural communities: an indigenous Brazilian community that has experienced severe collective adversity and a mountain village in Switzerland that has survived a natural disaster. We carried out separate qualitative metaphor analyses of semistructured interview data from each community. There were some similarities in the metaphorical narratives of the two cultural groups, for example, in metaphors of balance, changed perspective, collective cohesion and life as a journey. The main variations were found in metaphors of magical thinking, equilibrium and organic transformation used by the Brazilian group and metaphors of work, order and material transformation used by the Swiss group. Results from this study suggest that the Western-devised concepts of resilience and PTG can be further expanded, which is highlighted by the variety of culturally shared metaphors. Metaphorical idioms for overcoming severe adversity may be determined by the type of trauma as well as by the sociocultural and historical context. Our findings indicate potential approaches to the cultural adaptation of psychological interventions.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:152232,0.2402136921882629,0.0267120283097028,0.2445689141750335,0.3530074059963226,0.3375335931777954,0.0029820264317095,0.002211051993072,0.6374803781509399,0.0171974822878837,0.1370112895965576,0.880606472492218,0.7381539344787598,0.943665087223053,0.0116549711674451,0.0535375140607357,0.3815183937549591,0.050875999033451,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Character Strengths and Life Satisfaction in Later Life: an Analysis of Different Living Conditions
The aim of this study was to explore the role of character strengths and their associations to life satisfaction in older people. We were interested in studying several transitions that are specific for older people: aging, retirement, living alone, and being widowed. We examined the relationships of these demographic characteristics and living conditions with character strengths and studied their effects on the association of character strengths with life satisfaction. In a cross-sectional analysis, 15,598 older adults (aged 46–93 years) who had completed measures on character strengths, life satisfaction, and demographic characteristics and living conditions were selected from an existing database. Overall, analyses revealed positive associations of most character strengths with age, and higher scores in most character strengths for the employed (vs. the retired) and those living with a partner (vs. those living alone), while only few relationships with being widowed (vs. being married) were observed. Further, the contribution of character strengths to life satisfaction generally decreased slightly with age, but increased for certain character strengths, such as modesty or prudence. Also, stronger relationships between several character strengths and life satisfaction were found for retired people and those living alone, while being widowed did not affect these relationships. The results demonstrate how character strengths might contribute to the life satisfaction of older adults in various living conditions and thereby offer a starting point for strengths-based programs in later life.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:164864,0.6538786888122559,0.0486917421221733,0.0368732176721096,0.5902469754219055,0.8854272961616516,0.0024251472204923,0.0023213969543576,0.7987872362136841,0.0089164804667234,0.274119108915329,0.052287857979536,0.0102478619664907,0.0036517214030027,0.0044859563931822,0.0067554279230535,0.4921792149543762,0.2810650467872619,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Character Strengths and PERMA: Investigating the Relationships of Character Strengths with a Multidimensional Framework of Well-Being
Character strengths are positively valued traits that are expected to contribute to the good life (Peterson and Seligman 2004). Numerous studies have confirmed their robust relationships with subjective or hedonic well-being. Seligman (2011) provided a new framework of well-being suggesting five dimensions that encompass both hedonic and eudemonic aspects of well-being: positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning and accomplishment (forming the acronym PERMA). However, the role of character strengths has not been studied so far in this framework. Also, most studies on the relationships between character strengths and well-being only have only relied on self-reports. This set of two studies examines the relationships of character strengths and the orientations to well-being in two cross-sectional studies (Study 1: N = 5521), while also taking informant-reports into account and utilizing different questionnaires to control for a possible method bias (Study 2: N = 172). Participants completed validated assessments of character strengths and the PERMA dimensions (self-reports in Study 1, self- and informant-reports in Study 2). Results showed that in self-reports, all strengths were positively related to all PERMA dimensions, but there were differences in the size of the relationships. Accomplishment, for example, showed the strongest associations with strengths such as perspective, persistence, and zest, whereas for positive relationships, strengths such as teamwork, love, and kindness were the best predictors. These findings were largely confirmed by informant-reports in Study 2. The findings provide further support for the notion that character contributes to well-being and they could guide the development of strengths-based interventions tailored to individual needs.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:164854,0.0037396547850221,0.1143343150615692,0.9951255917549132,0.3931726515293121,0.613067626953125,0.0065202750265598,0.0018501845188438,0.1195399910211563,0.128220647573471,0.1647958308458328,0.0502641350030899,0.2711015939712524,0.0038654850795865,0.0282965507358312,0.0129283871501684,0.3363666832447052,0.1202419325709343,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"A cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of an individual planning intervention with collaborative planning in adolescent friendship dyads to enhance physical activity (TWOgether)
BACKGROUND: Most adolescents do not meet the recommendations for physical activity (PA) of at least 1 h per day. Individual planning (IP) interventions, including forming plans for when, where and how (action planning) to engage in a behavior, as well as the planning for how to deal with arising barriers (coping planning), are effective to enhance PA in adults. Collaborative planning (CP) is conjoint planning of two individuals regarding a behavior which is performed together. It is assumed that CP stimulates social exchange processes between the planning partners. However, it remains unclear whether planning interventions of PA in adolescents are successful and which planning intervention is more effective. Thus, this cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines changes in daily moderate-to-vigorous PA in adolescents' friendship dyads resulting from planning. Individual self-regulating mechanism and social exchange processes are proposed as mediating mechanisms of the effects of planning for health behavior change.

METHODS: A single-blind four-arm parallel-group cluster-RCT is used. The sample consists of 400 friendship dyads between 14 and 18 years of age. As the recruitment takes place in schools, a cluster randomization of the schools is used to enroll dyads to (a) an IP intervention, (b) a CP intervention or (c) one of the two no-planning control conditions. Devise-measured and self-reported PA as the primary outcomes, self-regulatory strategies, and social exchange processes as secondary outcomes are assessed at three or four time points. After baseline measurement, the baseline ecological momentary assessment of the main variables takes place for 8 days followed by the intervention and a 7-days diary phase. Follow-ups are 1 month and 6 months later. Subsequent to the six-month follow-up, another 7-days diary phase takes place.

DISCUSSION: This is the first study examining IP in comparison to CP in adolescents applying a single-blind cluster RCT. Consequently, the study allows for understanding the efficacy of individual and collaborative planning and the underlying mechanisms in adolescent dyads.

3,"Bi-directional associations between parental feeding practices and children's body mass in parent-child dyads
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether parental feeding practices, such as pressure to eat, permitting unhealthy food, and restriction of unhealthy food predict children's body mass index (BMI) percentile or if children's BMI percentiles predict parental feeding practices.

DESIGN: Longitudinal data were collected among 526 dyads of children (6-11 years old) and one of their parents. Parents reported parental feeding practices, restriction of unhealthy food, permission of unhealthy food, and pressure to eat. Children's weight and height were assessed objectively. All measurements were conducted twice with a time lag of 10 months.

RESULTS: Cross-lagged panel analyses demonstrated that low levels of children's BMI percentiles (measured at the baseline) predicted parental feeding practices (measured at the follow-up) but not vice versa. Only one effect suggesting bi-directionality was found, with parental restriction of unhealthy food preceding higher levels of children's BMI percentiles at the follow-up.

3,"What matters, parental or child perceptions of physical activity facilities? A prospective parent-child study explaining physical activity and body fat among children
Objectives: Research explaining childhood obesity has been usually focused on cognitive and behavioral predictors assessed in parents only or in children only. In contrast, the dyadic approach allows to evaluate how parental and child predictors operate together to explain child physical activity (PA) and body fat. This study investigated relationships among: (1) parental and child perceptions of accessibility and safety of exercise facilities for children, (2) parental and child PA, and (3) parental and child body fat percentage.

Design: A prospective and dyadic study with two measurement points was conducted. The follow up (Time 2) took place at 7–8-month after the baseline (Time 1).

Methods: Data were collected among 922 dyads of parents (mean age 35.97 years old; 83.9% women) and children (aged 6–11; M = 8.42, 52% girls). Parents and children reported safety and accessibility perceptions (Time 1) and PA (Time 1 and 2). Parental and child body fat were measured objectively (Time 1 and 2).

Results: Path analysis showed that parental perceptions of accessibility of PA facilities for children (Time 1) predicted child body fat and PA (Time 2). The associations were significant in a model accounting for longitudinal and cross-sectional associations between parental and child body fat and PA, controlling for age and gender of parents and children. Similar patterns of associations were found in the subsamples of dyads with children with normal body weight and with children with overweight/obesity.

3,"Does Despair Really Kill? A Roadmap for an Evidence-Based Answer
Two seemingly associated demographic trends have generated considerable interest: income stagnation and rising premature mortality from suicides, drug poisoning, and alcoholic liver disease among US non-Hispanic Whites with low education. Economists interpret these population-level trends to indicate that despair induced by financial stressors is a shared pathway to these causes of death. Although we now have the catchy term ""deaths of despair,"" we have yet to study its central empirical claim: that conceptually defined and empirically assessed ""despair"" is indeed a common pathway to several causes of death. At the level of the person, despair consists of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and biological domains. Despair can also permeate social relationships, networks, institutions, and communities. Extant longitudinal data sets feature repeated measures of despair-before, during, and after the Great Recession-offering resources to test the role that despair induced by economic decline plays in premature morbidity and mortality.

3,"Chronic disruptive pain in emerging adults with and without chronic health conditions and the moderating role of psychiatric disorders: Evidence from a population-based cross-sectional survey in Canada
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There has been a growth in the proportion of emerging adults vulnerable to pain-related sequelae of chronic health conditions (CHCs). Given the paucity of research during this important developmental period, this study investigated the association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain among emerging adults and the extent to which psychiatric disorders moderate this association.
METHODS: Data come from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health (CCHS-MH). This cross-sectional survey included 5987 participants that were 15-30 years of age and self-reported their CHCs (n=2460, 41%) and the extent to which pain impacted daily functioning using items from the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI 3). Group comparisons between respondents with CHCs and healthy controls were made using chi-square tests. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed from ordinal logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Product-term interactions between CHCs and psychiatric disorders were included in the models to explore moderating effects. All analyses were weighted to maintain representativeness of the study sample to the Canadian population.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 23.5 (SE 0.1) years and 48% were female. Compared to healthy controls, a greater proportion of participants with CHCs reported having chronic pain (20.3% vs. 4.5%, p<0.001). Among those with chronic pain, respondents with CHCs reported a greater number of activities prevented because of chronic disruptive pain (χ2=222.28, p<0.001). Similarly, in logistic regression models, participants with CHCs had greater odds of reporting chronic disruptive pain (OR=4.94, 95% CI=4.08-5.99). Alcohol (β=-0.66; p=0.025) and drug abuse/dependence disorders (β=-1.24; p=0.012) were found to moderate the association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain. Specifically, the probability of chronic disruptive pain was higher for emerging adults without CHCs and with alcohol or drug disorders; however, among participants with CHCs, probability was higher for those without these disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a robust association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain. The moderating effects suggest that alcohol or drug disorders are especially harmful for emerging adults without CHCs and contribute to higher levels of chronic disruptive pain; however, among those with CHCs, alcohol and illicit drugs may be used as a numbing agent to blunt chronic disruptive pain.
IMPLICATIONS: Findings from this study have implications for the integration and coordination of services to design strategies aimed at managing chronic disruptive pain and preventing pain-related disabilities later in life. Within the health system, healthcare providers should engage in dialogues about mental health and substance use regularly with emerging adults, be proactive in screening for psychiatric disorders, and continue to monitor the impact of pain on daily functioning. Given the age range of emerging adults, there is tremendous opportunity for clinicians to work cooperatively with colleagues in the education system to support emerging adults with and without CHCs. Overall, clinicians, researchers, educators, and those in social services should continue to be mindful of the complex interrelationships between physical and mental health and chronic disruptive pain and work cooperatively to optimize health outcomes and prevent pain-related disabilities among emerging adults.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:148344,0.2979543209075928,0.0114369075745344,0.9983230233192444,0.0286786127835512,0.7621166706085205,0.0039138309657573,0.0020886955317109,0.6727021336555481,0.0125494403764605,0.0868576392531395,0.02956716530025,0.0044490173459053,0.004905738402158,0.0044529899023473,0.0060488865710794,0.8730897307395935,0.4077682197093963,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Identifying relapse prevention elements during psychological treatment of depression: Development of an observer-based rating instrument
BACKGROUND
Although observer-rated instruments assessing therapist's adherence to relapse-preventive treatments are available, they do not adequately cover specific relapse-preventive elements that focus on implementation of strategies after terminating treatment. This study describes the development of the KERI-D (Kodierbogen zur Erfassung Rückfallprophylaktischer Interventionen bei Depression/Coding System to Assess Interventions of Relapse Prevention in Depression). The KERI-D is a new observer-based rating tool for acute or continuation/maintenance-phase sessions and assesses relapse-prevention elements including implementation into patient's daily routines.
METHODS
The development of the KERI-D included iterative steps referring to theoretical, clinical and empirical sources. It consists of 19 content items within four categories (self-care, early warning signs, triggering events/situations, termination of therapy) and one global item. For empirical analyses, videotaped psychotherapy sessions of 36 psychotherapies were rated by three independent observers and analyzed for their psychometric properties.
RESULTS
Most items showed moderate to good inter-rater reliability (median ICC = .80) and retest reliability (median ICC = .93). Principal-axis factor analysis revealed three subscales, and first evidence of content validity was demonstrated. No associations with clinical follow-up data were found.
LIMITATIONS
Analysis was limited to a relatively small sample of selected psychotherapy sessions. Evaluation of predictive validity is a desirable next step to further examine applicability and scope of the instrument.
CONCLUSIONS
The KERI-D is the first observer-based rating instrument measuring specific relapse-prevention strategies in psychotherapy for depression. It may help to identify elements that prove effective in reducing relapse/recurrence in the long-term and thereby help to optimize effect duration of depression treatment.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:164827,0.0040001110173761,0.0294360294938087,0.9985820055007936,0.0018907154444605,0.003323005978018,0.0063068806193768,0.0019970263820141,0.0200904887169599,0.4689274132251739,0.0602840408682823,0.0389019511640071,0.0042447866871953,0.0052740867249667,0.0033594060223549,0.0049502118490636,0.3420062065124511,0.6396278738975525,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

OBJECTIVE

Case management (CM) programs are intended to improve care coordination for cancer patients. This quasi-experimental, controlled study evaluated whether such a program was effective in improving health-related quality of life and reducing the psychological distress of breast cancer patients.

For the study, 126 patients with CM and 118 patients with treatment as usual (TAU) were surveyed at baseline, a 6-month follow-up and a 12-month follow-up. Comparisons of the two groups with regard to quality of life (Short Form-8, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-11; primary outcome) and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, distress thermometer; secondary outcome) were conducted.

RESULTS

Univariate t-tests regarding the primary and secondary outcomes demonstrated improvements in the relevant outcomes at the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups for the intervention group as well as for the control group. An analysis of covariance revealed that the controls showed a higher level of physical quality of life at the 12-month follow-up than the other time points and no differences at 6 months after the baseline.

CONCLUSIONS

The tested CM model did not improve the quality of life or psychological well-being of the patients beyond treatment as usual. Possible reasons include that the treatment was already of high standards in the control group or that there are possibly different impacts than found in the literature regarding different forms of organization in CM. The need for and the tailoring of this CM model as well as the transfer of CM to other oncological indications remain to be clarified.

3,"Amylin - its role in the homeostatic and hedonic control of eating and recent developments of amylin analogs to treat obesity
BACKGROUND: Amylin is a pancreatic β-cell hormone that produces effects in several different organ systems. One of its best-characterized effects is the reduction in eating and body weight seen in preclinical and clinical studies. Amylin activates specific receptors, a portion of which it shares with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Amylin's role in the control of energy metabolism relates to its satiating effect, but recent data indicate that amylin may also affect hedonic aspects in the control of eating, including a reduction of the rewarding value of food. Recently, several amylin-based peptides have been characterized. Pramlintide (Symlin®) is currently the only one being used clinically to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However other amylin analogs with improved pharmacokinetic properties are being considered as anti-obesity treatment strategies. Several other studies in obesity have shown that amylin agonists could also be useful for weight loss, especially in combination with other agents.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review will briefly summarize amylin physiology and pharmacology and then focus on amylin's role in food reward and the effects of amylin analogs in pre-clinical testing for anti-obesity drugs.
CONCLUSION: We propose here that the effects of amylin may be homeostatic and hedonic in nature.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:148159,0.0038220230489969,0.9693924188613892,0.9015097618103028,0.003849975997582,0.002196688670665,0.0070811612531542,0.9568961262702942,0.0098129529505968,0.1451963782310485,0.023038750514388,0.0306258704513311,0.9429111480712892,0.0053049158304929,0.0052942652255296,0.0245643481612205,0.0048402021639049,0.013420189730823,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Considering our methods: Methodological issues with rodent models of appetite and obesity research
A large number of animal models are currently used in appetite and obesity research. Because the worldwide incidence of obesity continues to climb, it is imperative that animal models sharing characteristics of human obesity and its co-morbidities be used appropriately in the quest for novel preventions or treatments. There is probably no animal model, at least in rodents, that recapitulates all aspects of ""common"" human obesity and its comorbidities, but rodent models allow insight into specific mechanisms of disease or its consequences. Frequently used obesity models can be partitioned into different categories, the major ones being a) based on mutations or manipulations of one or a few individual genes or b) those in genetically intact animals exposed to obesogenic environments such as, e.g., being maintained on high-fat diets or being raised in small litters. Characteristics of these models include distinct phenotypes of obesity, hyperphagia or changes in energy metabolism, and frequent comorbidities of obesity, like hyperglycemia, insulin resistance or diabetes-like syndromes. This review which is based on a presentation given during the Annual Meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior in July 2017 points out some observations and characteristics of rodent models in obesity and diabetes research. The choice of rodent models discussed here is subjective and based on the author's own experience or on fruitful discussions with colleagues about the pros and cons of specific models. Hence, this review, by no means, is meant to give a complete picture of rodent models used in this type of research, but the review tries to bring up some issues which, in the author's mind, may also be relevant for models not discussed here. For example, by discussing specific mouse and rat models, similarities and differences between mice and rats will be discussed that need to be considered to interpret experimental findings cautiously and in the context of the respective animal model. Knowing which animal model to use means, knowing its limitations.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:152882,0.0038948911242187,0.8450000882148743,0.886858344078064,0.0351978875696659,0.0071188230067491,0.0136648602783679,0.9126524925231934,0.0175061207264661,0.4213250875473022,0.0475513488054275,0.0326880812644958,0.6308255195617676,0.0046303556300699,0.0197926498949527,0.297614187002182,0.1366596072912216,0.2415311783552169,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Bacterial genome sequencing and analysis: paving the way for a Swiss-wide molecular epidemiological surveillance platform
Facing multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens is one of the most important challenges for our society. The spread of highly virulent and resistant pathogens can be described using molecular typing technologies; in particular, whole genome sequencing (WGS) data can be usedf or molecular typing purposes with high resolution. WGS data analysis can explain the spatiotemporal patterns of pathogen transmission. However, the transmission between compartments (human, animal, food, environment) is very complex. Interoperable and curated metadata are a key requirement for fully understanding this complexity. In addition, high quality sequence data are a key element between centres using WGS data for diagnostic and epidemiological applications. We aim to describe steps to improve WGS data analysis and to implement a molecular surveillance platform allowing integration of high resolution WGS typing data and epidemiological data.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167656,0.0039971293881535,0.9485580325126648,0.9969719648361206,0.0016970183933153,0.0020228386856615,0.140771746635437,0.0694451853632927,0.0160739794373512,0.937492847442627,0.0128216361626982,0.0929097086191177,0.6827283501625061,0.0043569221161305,0.0687915310263633,0.5753070116043091,0.0028074660804122,0.0297500099986791,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Detection of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA in raw cured sausages and raw cured sausages containing pig liver at retail stores in Switzerland
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of an acute and self-limiting hepatitis and is increasingly detected in food products containing pork. In this study, 102 raw sausages containing pig liver (mortadella di fegato) and 18 raw pork sausages (salami type sausage) collected at retail level in a region of southern Switzerland were screened for the presence of HEV by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. HEV was detected in 12 (11.8%) of 102 mortadella di fegato products but not in any of the salami sausages. Viral loads in the mortadella di fegato sausages ranged from log HEV 2.3 to 5.7 genome copies per gram of food product.

3,"Microbiological quality and presence of foodborne pathogens in raw milk cheeses and raw meat products marketed at farm level in Switzerland
This study investigated the microbiological quality and presence of bacterial foodborne pathogens in 51 raw milk cheeses (mainly semihard and hard cheese) and 53 raw meat products (cured meat products and sausages) marketed at farm level. With regard to Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia (E.) coli, and coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), the examined products were generally of a good microbiological quality. Enterobacteriaceae were found in seven cheeses (1.0×102 – 8.8×104 CFU/g) and one sausage (2.0×102 CFU/g). Three of these cheeses were also positive for E. coli. CPS results were comparable for cheeses (5.9%; 1.0-6.0×102 CFU/g) and meat products (3.8%; 1.0-2.0×102 CFU/g). On the other hand, such raw products may harbor potential health hazards as Listeria (L.) monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), and staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE)-producing Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. L. monocytogenes were found in one sausage and the isolate belonged to the serotype 1/2c. The two STEC isolates harbored stx1a (cheese) or stx2e (sausage), but both lacked eae and did not belong to the top five-serogroups. Of the five S. aureus isolates, the three cheese isolates belonged to the clonal complex (CC) 8, CC22, and CC705, the two sausage isolates belonged to CC7, and all isolates harbored genes for SEs. Thus, to avoid contaminations and to prevent foodborne pathogens from entering the food chain, strict compliance with good hygiene practices during milk and cheese production or meat production is of central importance.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168068,0.0041284221224486,0.8852835893630981,0.5440165400505066,0.0015349963214248,0.0019634333439171,0.2592038214206695,0.0019532560836523,0.0056914496235549,0.2056007832288742,0.0080821122974157,0.0267841443419456,0.970527172088623,0.0047683110460639,0.7287076115608215,0.0882079303264617,0.0028370397631078,0.009727643802762,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Toxin genes and cytotoxicity levels detected in Bacillus cereus isolates collected from cooked food products delivered by Swiss Army catering facilities
Heated food is known to be often contaminated with B. cereus, leading to cases of diarrhoeal or emetic diseases. Battalion kitchens or army catering facilities present a food safety risk, as temperature abuse and long storage time can result in serious public health problems affecting a high number of served people. In contrast to civil catering facilities, no microbiological monitoring systems are currently implemented in Swiss military kitchens. In this study toxin gene profiles and cytotoxicity levels of 21 isolates of B. cereus originating from six different food categories were determined. Nearly all isolates (95%) harbored the nhe gene, whereas no hbl could be detected. Seven isolates displayed the cytK2 gene and one cereulide-producer was isolated out of vegetables. While most isolates displayed low cytotoxicity, highly cytotoxic strains were detected, with three isolates even exceeding the cytotoxicity level of the reference strain for high-level toxin production, underpinning that cytotoxicity cannot be deduced only from presence or absence of toxin genes. These findings further underline the importance of rapid cooling of foods or maintenance over 65°C before serving. This is especially important in mass catering facilities, such as military kitchens, in which food is often prepared a long time in advance.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167858,0.0041361968033015,0.8934277892112732,0.6104833483695984,0.0015209456905722,0.001960985828191,0.0304975640028715,0.6454271078109741,0.0085668843239545,0.6920956373214722,0.0076824626885354,0.137229710817337,0.5028043985366821,0.0049704196862876,0.0499606616795063,0.0184204597026109,0.3812287747859955,0.0324758179485797,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Bovine leptospirosis in abattoirs in Uganda: Molecular detection and risk of exposure among workers
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease reported worldwide. In Uganda, seropositivity has been reported in both humans and domesticated animals, including cattle. However, it remains unknown whether cattle are shedding leptospires and thus acting as potential source for human leptospirosis. We conducted this cross-sectional study in two cattle abattoirs in Kampala, Uganda between June and July 2017. Kidney and urine samples from 500 cattle sourced from across the country were analysed by real-time PCR to establish the prevalence of Leptospira-positive cattle and risk of exposure to abattoir workers. The species of infecting Leptospira was determined by amplification of secY gene and compared to reference sequences published in GenBank. Of 500 cattle tested, 36 (7.2%) had Leptospira DNA in their kidneys (carriers), 29 (5.8%) in their urine (shedders); with an overall prevalence (kidney and/or urine) of 8.8%. Leptospira borgpetersenii was confirmed as the infecting species in three cattle and Leptospira kirschneri in one animal. Male versus female cattle (OR = 3, p-value 0.003), exotic versus local breeds (OR = 21.3, p-value 0.002) or cattle from Western Uganda (OR = 4.4, p-value 0.001) and from regions across the border (OR = 3.3, p-value 0.032) versus from the central region were more likely to be Leptospira-positive. The daily risk of exposure of abattoir workers to ≥1 (kidney and/or urine) positive carcass ranged from 27% (95% credibility interval 18.6-52.3) to 100% (95% CI 91.0-100.0), with halal butchers and pluck inspectors being at highest risk. In conclusion, cattle slaughtered at abattoirs in Uganda carry and shed pathogenic Leptospira species; and this may pose occupation-related risk of exposure among workers in these abattoirs, with workers who handle larger numbers of animals being at higher risk.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:171543,0.0057110250927507,0.758806049823761,0.5818628668785095,0.0020668278448283,0.7421025037765503,0.0225910916924476,0.0025533230509608,0.7922695875167847,0.0387723557651042,0.0878915339708328,0.0244201533496379,0.3700365126132965,0.0047128102742135,0.1184048727154731,0.1354674398899078,0.003060718299821,0.0224488843232393,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
3,"Economic and health burden of brucellosis in Kazakhstan
Brucellosis is a widespread zoonotic disease considered as an emerging and re-emerging disease with a resulting threat of public health and animal health. Official reports document an animal incidence in Kazakhstan of about 0.6% per year, and the country still registers high number of human cases annually . The main objective of this paper was to evaluate the distribution and economic impact of brucellosis in Kazakhstan. We analysed human disease incidence data obtained from the Government Sanitary & Epidemiological Service with the aim to estimate the burden of disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We also estimated the economic impact in terms of monetary losses. Additionally, we mapped the geographical distribution of the disease throughout Kazakhstan. In total, 1,334 human cases of brucellosis were registered in 2015 in Kazakhstan that resulted in 713 DALYs. Around US Dollar 21 million was spent on compensation for animals that had to be slaughtered due to brucellosis, and an additional US Dollar 24 million was spent on testing animals. Animal brucellosis and human brucellosis occur throughout the whole country, some trends of which are reviewed in this paper. We estimated the burden of the disease and explored possible explanation for high human incidence rates. This paper is the first to estimate the human burden of disease and the economic costs in Kazakhstan.

3,"Epidemiology of Taenia saginata taeniosis/cysticercosis: a systematic review of the distribution in central and western Asia and the Caucasus
BACKGROUND: The zoonotic parasite Taenia saginata transmits between humans, the definitive host (causing taeniosis), and bovines as the intermediate host (causing cysticercosis). Central and western Asia and the Caucasus have large cattle populations and beef consumption is widespread. However, an overview of the extent of human T. saginata infection and bovine cysticercosis is lacking. This review aims to summarize the distribution of T. saginata in this region.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, that gathered published and grey literature, and official data concerning T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis in central and western Asia and the Caucasus published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2018. Where no data were available for a country within this period, published data from 1985-1990 were also accessed.
RESULTS: From 10,786 articles initially scanned, we retrieved 98 full-text articles from which data were extracted. In addition, two unpublished datasets were provided on the incidence of human taeniosis. Data for human taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis were found for all countries except Turkmenistan. Human taeniosis prevalence varied from undetected to over 5.3%, with regional variations. Where bovine cysticercosis was detected, prevalences varied from case reports to 25%.
CONCLUSIONS: The public health burden of T. saginata is assumed to be small as the parasite is of low pathogenicity to humans. However, this review indicates that infection continues to be widespread and this may result in a large economic burden, due to the resources utilized in meat inspection and condemnation or processing with subsequent downgrading of infected carcasses.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170443,0.0113644888624548,0.8257761001586914,0.998494267463684,0.0015978988958522,0.0042898962274193,0.0583973415195941,0.0021435716189444,0.0821821317076683,0.6437429785728455,0.0683716386556625,0.0829087793827056,0.6829541325569153,0.0045086429454386,0.1903822571039199,0.0479961186647415,0.0029575172811746,0.5837187170982361,Good Health and Well-being,Aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.
5,"A glass ceiling in the online age? Explaining the underrepresentation of women in online political news
In previous decades, women in Western countries have gained more influence in various social realms. The percentage of females in higher education, the workforce, boards at publicly traded companies and national parliaments has increased. However, substantial underrepresentation of women in political news has remained. To explain the reasons behind this gender imbalance in news content, we conducted a content analysis of different types of online news in six Western countries. In our study, we distinguish among three levels of analysis: (1) the story level (frequency and format), (2) the media organization level (popular vs mass and upmarket outlets) and (3) the societal level. The results indicate that female actors are most frequently covered by popular news outlets and are more likely to be depicted in a photograph. Furthermore, strong determinants of continued gender differences in political news were found at the country level.

5,"Gender bias in media coverage of election campaigns
We study gender bias in media coverage of candidates during election campaigns. Our analysis focuses on the 2015 Swiss national elections and relies on an almost comprehensive sample of print and online news items covering the full duration of the campaign, including over 200,000 documents from 70 sources and all 3,927 candidates. First, we analyze media attention with regression methods and find a significant gender gap, except for incumbents. Second, we use structural topic models to identify the main themes of newspaper coverage and how they covary with the candidates’ gender.

5,"Newspaper coverage of female candidates during election cam paigns: evidence from a structural topic model
This paper studies how female candidates are covered by newspapers during election campaigns. Previous studies have generally found that the media portray men and women quite similarly, but they have tended to use relatively selective sources and to focus on the amount of coverage and its tone, but not on on its content. We aim to gain a more nuanced understanding of this phenomenon by focusing on the Swiss national elections 2015, relying on an almost comprehensive sample of news items covering most of the duration of the campaign. Our dataset includes about 205,000 documents from 70 sources, covering over 3,900 male and female politicians. We analyze these texts first with a focus on the amount of coverage and second using structural topic models, a natural language processing technique that allows us to identify inductively the themes (topics) of newspaper coverage and, importantly, how the candidates’ gender is linked to both the topics and the language used to discuss them. Results reveal a gender bias in media attention only for non-incumbent candidates. Moreover, some topics, such as the one referring to the election campaign, is discussed more frequently in connection with female candidates, while others, such as topics focusing on personality and political profiles, are more prevalent in articles mentioning men. We uncover no major gender bias in the language used for these topics.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:143863,0.003870271379128,0.0490310080349445,0.0252569243311882,0.732934832572937,0.9959130883216858,0.0021509656216949,0.0022497547324746,0.2810130715370178,0.0091807460412383,0.1586011797189712,0.091028094291687,0.5893936157226562,0.004460803233087,0.0039386306889355,0.0094156712293624,0.717841625213623,0.1024017930030822,Gender Equality,Aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.
5,"The influence of gender ratios on academic careers: Combining social networks with tokenism
This paper examines how gender proportions at the workplace affect the extent to which individual networks support the career progress (i.e. time to promotion). Previous studies have argued that men and women benefit from different network structures. However, the empirical evidence about these differences has been contradictory or inconclusive at best. Combining social networks with tokenism, we show in a longitudinal academic study that gender-related differences in the way that networks affect career progress exist only in situations where women are in a token position.

5,"Fix the game, not the dame: Restoring equity in leadership evaluations
Female leaders continue to face bias in the workplace compared to male leaders. When employees are evaluated differently because of who they are rather than how they perform, an ethical dilemma arises for leaders and organizations. Thus, bridging role congruity and social identity leadership theories, we propose that gender biases in leadership evaluations can be overcome by manipulating diversity at the team level. Across two multiple-source, multiple-wave, and randomized field experiments, we test whether team gender composition restores gender equity in leadership evaluations. In Study 1, we find that male leaders are rated as more prototypical in male-dominated groups, an advantage that is eliminated in gender-balanced groups. In Study 2, we replicate and extend this finding by showing that leader gender and team gender composition interact to predict trust in the leader via perceptions of leader prototypicality. The results show causal support for the social identity model of organizational leadership and a boundary condition of role congruity theory. Beyond moral arguments of fairness, our findings also show how, in the case of gender, team diversity can create a more level playing field for leaders. Finally, we outline the implications of our results for leaders, organizations, business ethics, and society.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:150948,0.0036073613446205,0.0390840321779251,0.0178114119917154,0.7150300741195679,0.9963756203651428,0.0034702355042099,0.0022192925680428,0.8619943857192993,0.1352272480726242,0.989802062511444,0.0157241970300674,0.0037402145098894,0.0034408464562147,0.0027969717048108,0.0061700884252786,0.3805069625377655,0.0927159115672111,Gender Equality,Aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

5,"Gender gaps in the effects of childhood family environment: Do they persist into adulthood?
We examine the differential effects of family disadvantage on the education and adult labor market outcomes of men and women using high-quality administrative data on the entire population of Denmark born between 1966 and 1995. We link parental education and family structure during childhood to male–female and brother–sister differences in adolescent outcomes, educational attainment, and adult earnings and employment. Our results are consistent with U.S. findings that boys benefit more from an advantageous family environment than do girls in terms of grade-school outcomes. Father’s education, which has not been examined in previous studies, is particularly important for sons. However, we find a very different pattern of parental influence on adult outcomes. Gender gaps in educational attainment, employment, and earnings are increasing in maternal education, benefiting daughters. Paternal education decreases the gender gaps in educational attainment (favoring sons) and labor market outcomes (favoring daughters). We conclude that differences in the behavior of school-aged boys and girls may be poor proxies for differences in skills that drive longer-term outcomes.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:161018,0.9945843815803528,0.0241782236844301,0.7095658183097839,0.9825682044029236,0.9920828342437744,0.0038765729404985,0.0023712576366961,0.9898271560668944,0.0098312720656394,0.2061464488506317,0.014160125516355,0.0057077608071267,0.0039338446222245,0.002983295591548,0.3907709121704101,0.0339102931320667,0.0641443058848381,Gender Equality,Aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

5,"The ""end of men"" and rise of women in the high-skilled labor market
We document a new finding regarding changes in labor market outcomes for high-skilled men and women in the US. Since 1980, conditional on being a college-educated man, the probability of working in a cognitive/high-wage occupation has fallen. This contrasts starkly with the experience for college-educated women: their probability of working in these occupations rose, despite a much larger increase in the supply of educated women relative to men. We show that one key channel capable of rationalizing these findings is a greater increase in the demand for female-oriented skills in cognitive/high-wage occupations relative to other occupations. Using occupation-level data, we find evidence that this relative increase in the demand for female skills is due to an increasing importance of social skills within such occupations. Evidence from both male and female wages is also indicative of an increase in the demand for social skills.

Through the custom of guardianship, husbands typically have the final word on their wives’ labor supply decisions in Saudi Arabia, a country with very low female labor force participation (FLFP). We provide incentivized evidence (both from an experimental sample in Riyadh and from a national sample) that the vast majority of young married men in Saudi Arabia privately support FLFP outside of home from a normative perspective, while they substantially underestimate the level of support for FLFP by other similar men – even men from their same social setting, such as their neighbors. We then show that randomly correcting these beliefs about others increases married men’s willingness to let their wives join the labor force (as measured by their costly sign-up for a job-matching service for their wives). Finally, we find that this decision maps onto real outcomes: four months after the main intervention, the wives of men in our original sample whose beliefs about acceptability of FLFP were corrected are more likely to have applied and interviewed for a job outside of home.

SNFs are coated on glass beads and subsequently modified with biocidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The enlarged surface area of SNFs allows a 30 times higher loading of AgNPs in comparison to glass beads without SNF coating. Thus, in column experiments, the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified glass beads exert superior antibacterial activity towards suspensions of E. coli K12 compared to AgNP functionalized glass beads without SNFs. Additionally, reusing the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-coated glass beads with fresh bacteria contaminated medium increases their efficacy and reduces the colony forming units by ≈6 log units. Thereby, the silver loss during percolation is below 0.1 μg mL−1. These results highlight, first, the potential of AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified glass beads as an effective filter substrate for water disinfection, and second, the efficiency of SNF coating in increasing the contact area of conventional filter material.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:131354,0.004021895583719,0.0719868317246437,0.0420429185032844,0.0017923434497788,0.0021285465918481,0.996831238269806,0.3968856334686279,0.0055731744505465,0.1641331613063812,0.0033264076337218,0.0516610071063041,0.5887876152992249,0.0050453590229153,0.195130705833435,0.266400933265686,0.0032704789191484,0.0095949321985244,Clean Water and Sanitation,Aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
6,"Modeling of future changes in seasonal snowpack and impacts on summer low flows in alpine catchments
It is expected that an increasing proportion of the precipitation will fall as rain in alpine catchments in the future. Consequently, snow storage is expected to decrease, which, together with changes in snowmelt rates and timing, might cause reductions in spring and summer low flows. The objectives of this study were (1) to simulate the effect of changing snow storage on low flows during the warm seasons and (2) to relate drought sensitivity to the simulated snow storage changes at different elevations. The Swiss Climate Change Scenarios 2011 data set was used to derive future changes in air temperature and precipitation. A typical bucket‐type catchment model, HBV‐light, was applied to 14 mountain catchments in Switzerland to simulate streamflow and snow in the reference period and three future periods. The largest relative decrease in annual maximum SWE was simulated for elevations below 2,200 m a.s.l. (60–75% for the period 2070–2099) and the snowmelt season shifted by up to 4 weeks earlier. The relative decrease in spring and summer minimum runoff that was caused by the relative decrease in maximum SWE (i.e., elasticity), reached 40–90% in most of catchments for the reference period and decreased for the future periods. This decreasing elasticity indicated that the effect of snow on summer low flows is reduced in the future. The fraction of snowmelt runoff in summer decreased by more than 50% at the highest elevations and almost disappeared at the lowest elevations. This might have large implications on water availability during the summer.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:160115,0.0039449627511203,0.0925456210970878,0.0173523630946874,0.0018960245652124,0.0021872709039598,0.981589138507843,0.0084527982398867,0.0063387020491063,0.0093820635229349,0.0036691499408334,0.2880386710166931,0.2046684473752975,0.9625871181488036,0.1946137547492981,0.7072123289108276,0.00308901630342,0.009297301992774,Clean Water and Sanitation,Aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

7,"Discovery of Open Cubane Core Structures for Biomimetic LnCo3 (OR)4 Water Oxidation Catalysts
Bio-mimetic catalysts such as LnCo3(OR)4 (Ln=Er, Tm; OR=alkoxide) cubanes have recently been in the focus of research for artificial water oxidation processes. Previously, the remarkable adaptability with respect to ligand shell, nuclear structure as well as protonation and oxidation states of those catalysts has been shown to be beneficial for the water oxidation process. We further explored the structural flexibility of those catalysts and present here a series of novel structures in which one metal center is pulled out of the cubane cage. This leads to an open cubane core, which is to some extent reminiscent of observed open/closed cubane-core forms of the oxygen-evolving complex in nature's photosystem II.

7,"Ruthenium Water Oxidation Catalysts based on Pentapyridyl Ligands
Ruthenium complexes containing the pentapyridyl ligand 6,6′′-(methoxy(pyridin-2-yl)methylene)di-2,2′-bipyridine (L-OMe) of general formula trans-[RuII(X)(L-OMe-κ-N5)]n+ (X=Cl, n=1, trans-1+; X=H2O, n=2, trans-22+) have been isolated and characterized in solution (by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy) and in the solid state by XRD. Both complexes undergo a series of substitution reactions at oxidation state RuII and RuIII when dissolved in aqueous triflic acid–trifluoroethanol solutions as monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy, and the corresponding rate constants were determined. In particular, aqueous solutions of the RuIII-Cl complex trans-[RuIII(Cl)(L-OMe-κ-N5)]2+ (trans-12+) generates a family of Ru aquo complexes, namely trans-[RuIII(H2O)(L-OMe-κ-N5)]3+ (trans-23+), [RuIII(H2O)2(L-OMe-κ-N4)]3+ (trans-33+), and [RuIII(Cl)(H2O)(L-OMe-κ-N4)]2+ (trans-42+). Although complex trans-42+ is a powerful water oxidation catalyst, complex trans-23+ has only a moderate activity and trans-33+ shows no activity. A parallel study with related complexes containing the methyl-substituted ligand 6,6′′-(1-pyridin-2-yl)ethane-1,1-diyl)di-2,2′-bipyridine (L-Me) was carried out. The behavior of all of these catalysts has been rationalized based on substitution kinetics, oxygen evolution kinetics, electrochemical properties, and density functional theory calculations.

7,"Trends in the phase stability and thermochemical oxygen exchange of ceria doped with potentially tetravalent metals
Ceria is among the most prominent materials for generating clean fuels through solar thermochemical CO2 reduction and water splitting. The main optimization parameter for ceria in solar reactors is the oxygen exchange capacity (OEC, Dd), which can be notably improved through various dopant types. Among them, tetravalent dopants excel through the formation of active vacancies which lead to particularly high OEC values. We thus performed a comprehensive screening evaluation of all dopants in the periodic table which have been reported to adopt an oxidation state of +IV. All thermally stable doped ceria samples, M0.1Ce0.9O2d (M ¼ Si, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Rh, Hf, Ta, Nb, V, Pr, and Tb), were first analyzed for Dd improvement with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Dopant solubility limits and behavior in the ceria host lattice was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX) and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. No indications for carbonate side product formation were found. Hf-, Zr-, and Ta-doped ceria display higher OEC than pristine ceria, and Raman spectroscopy indicated that their improved performance is accompanied by a higher versatility in the underlying vacancy formation processes. Furthermore, the effective dopant radii are close to an optimal dopant radius around 0.8 °A for maximum Dd according to TGA cycling experiments. These experimentally derived trends for doped ceria were supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations which analogously correlate Dd with the partial electronic charge of the metal dopants.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:147140,0.0039829732850193,0.0314235128462314,0.0227898880839347,0.0018152497941628,0.0021889596246182,0.9964224100112916,0.9642706513404846,0.3448295593261719,0.6112399101257324,0.0033874930813908,0.0141431232914328,0.6625061631202698,0.0049338680692017,0.0731915459036827,0.0550406798720359,0.0030283748637884,0.0095870504155755,Affordable and Clean Energy,"Aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and clean energy for all."

The development of economic water oxidation catalysts is a key step toward large-scale water splitting. However, their current exploration remains empirical to a large extent. Elucidating the correlations between electronic properties and catalytic activity is crucial for deriving general and straightforward catalyst design principles. Herein, strongly correlated electronic systems with abundant and easily tunable electronic properties, namely La1–xSrxBO3 perovskites and La2-xSrxBO4 layered perovskites (B = Fe, Co, Ni, or Mn), were employed as model systems to identify favorable electronic structures for water oxidation. We established a direct correlation between the enhancement of catalytic activity and the insulator to metal transition through tuning the electronic properties of the target perovskite families via the La3+/Sr2+ ratio. Their improved photochemical water oxidation performance was clearly linked to the increasingly metallic character.

7,"Extended Light Harvesting with Dual Cu2O-Based Photocathodes for High Efficiency Water Splitting
Cu2O is one of the most promising light absorbing materials for solar energy conversion. Previous studies with Cu2O for water splitting usually deliver high photocurrent or high photovoltage, but not both. Here, a Cu2O/Ga2O3/TiO2/RuOx photocathode that benefits from a high quality thermally oxidized Cu2O layer and good band alignment of the Ga2O3 buffer layer is reported, yielding a photocurrent of 6 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), an onset potential of 0.9 V versus RHE, and 3.5 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V versus RHE. The quantum efficiency spectrum (incident photon to current efficiency, IPCE) reveals a dramatically improved green/red response and a decreased blue response compared with electrodeposited Cu2O films. Light intensity dependence and photocurrent transient studies enable the identification of the limitations in the performance. Due to the complementary IPCE curves of thermally oxidized and electrodeposited Cu2O photocathodes, a dual photocathode is fabricated to maximize the absorption over the entire range of above band gap radiation. Photocurrents of 7 mA cm−2 at 0 V versus RHE are obtained in the dual photocathodes, with an onset potential of 0.9 V versus RHE and a thermodynamically based energy conversion efficiency of 1.9%.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:146991,0.0040639066137373,0.0987320765852928,0.0133769996464252,0.0018141149776056,0.0021125809289515,0.9964345693588256,0.995981216430664,0.0162216182798147,0.2709639370441437,0.0035038362257182,0.0237375311553478,0.8847222328186035,0.0046507744118571,0.015304435044527,0.0352148711681366,0.0032309563830494,0.0094363465905189,Affordable and Clean Energy,"Aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and clean energy for all."

7,"Adaptive home heating under weather and price uncertainty using GPs and MDPs
We consider the problem of adaptive home heating in the smart grid, assuming that real-time electricity prices are being exposed to end-users with the goal of realizing demand-side management. To lower the burden on the end-users, our goal is the design of a smart thermostat that automatically heats the home, optimally trading o the user’s comfort and cost. This is a challenging problem due to two sources of uncertainty: future weather conditions and future electricity prices. Our main technical contribution is a general technique that uses predictive distributions obtained from Gaussian Process (GP) regressions to compute the state transition probabilities of an MDP, such that the solution to the resulting MDP constitutes a sequentially optimal policy.

8,"Struggling for the moral market: Economic knowledge, diverse markets, and market borders
Focusing on the recent emergence of behavioral and experimental economics and its implications for the design and implementation of social policies, we demonstrate that geographies of marketization are not confined to the narrow study of the models of neoclassical economics. We structure our argument around what we perceive as key dimensions of marketization and their variegated geographies: First, we argue for renewed attention to the naturalization of abstract market knowledge and its methodological separation from real markets in the wake of the behavioral and experimental turn. We then turn to really existing markets, conceptualizing them as articulations of a variety of economic and social rationalities struggling over an apparent “moral market.” Third, we focus on the role of the nonhuman in marketization processes and discuss the work of market devices in making these market arrangements possible. In the fourth and final section we turn to the “human side” of marketization. Our argument is that market struggles connect with the formation of “quasi-subjects” that oscillate between attempts to reestablish autonomy and their dissolution in the disciplining webs of behavioral and experimental market devices. Throughout the text we illustrate our arguments on the so-called social impact bonds as a concrete example for the types of policy intervention informed by economic behaviorism and experimentalism.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:161238,0.0036599054001271,0.0075120171532034,0.0251088086515665,0.0364980101585388,0.0036983008030802,0.0016785667976364,0.0020320126786828,0.1194239556789398,0.5166013240814209,0.8590787649154663,0.0256700385361909,0.0045408364385366,0.0378242544829845,0.0023285532370209,0.0060483482666313,0.315208226442337,0.4731633067131042,Decent Work and Economic Growth,"Aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."
8,"The middle space of migration: a case study on brokerage and recruitment agencies in Nepal
Foreign employment has become a global phenomenon. With the increasing commercialisation and formalisation of transnational labour migration, recruitment agencies and agents have gained importance. The paper aims to contribute to a more differentiated understanding of the role and the practices of the main actors in the middle space of migration, the brokers in the recruitment process for transnational migration. Based on empirical material from Nepal, it argues that the detected negative reputation of labour brokers is only partially justified. Besides common bad practices and fraud cases, recruiters perform important roles for the facilitation of transnational mobility and present the necessary infrastructure for labour migration. They connect people and places, establish networks and can play an important role in making migration safer. Brokers are important facilitators in supporting alternative income strategies and new livelihood options of people. At the same time they are entrepreneurs in a competitive and risky economic field, confronted with multifaceted constraints. As long as the gap between the dreams of potential migrants and the reality of marginality in Nepal remains wide, labour brokers might persist as important middlemen for global work. Thus, migration brokerage is likely to remain big business.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:111984,0.9402962923049928,0.0336540453135967,0.012614824809134,0.0041696839034557,0.0044753067195415,0.0060926456935703,0.002387361600995,0.991743266582489,0.9833340048789978,0.994265615940094,0.0917703062295913,0.0039453189820051,0.0037483503110706,0.0022707062307745,0.0080834729596972,0.8881357312202454,0.4664322137832641,Decent Work and Economic Growth,"Aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."

8,"Interconnectedness as a Source of Uncertainty in Systemic Risk
Financial networks have shown to be important in understanding systemic events in credit markets. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of those networks can affect the capacity of regulators to assess the level of systemic risk. We introduce a model to compute the individual and systemic probability of default in a system of banks connected in a generic network of credit contracts and exposed to external shocks with a generic correlation structure. Even in the presence of complete knowledge, we identify conditions on the network for the emergence of multiple equilibria. Multiple equilibria give rise to uncertainty in the determination of the default probability. We show how this uncertainty can affect the estimation of systemic risk in terms of expected losses. We further quantify the effects of cyclicality, leverage, volatility and correlations.

8,"Time versus state in insurance: experimental evidence from contract farming in Kenya
The gains from insurance arise from the transfer of income across states. Yet, by requiring that the premium be paid upfront, standard insurance products also transfer income across time. We show that this intertemporal transfer can help explain low insurance demand, especially among the poor, and in a randomized control trial in Kenya we test a crop insurance product which removes it. The product is interlinked with a contract farming scheme: as with other inputs, the buyer of the crop offers the insurance and deducts the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The take-up rate for pay-at-harvest insurance is 72 percent, compared to 5 percent for the standard pay-up-front contract, and the difference is largest among poorer farmers. Additional experiments and outcomes provide evidence on the role of liquidity constraints, present bias, and counterparty risk, and find that enabling farmers to commit to pay the premium just one month later increases demand by 21 percentage points.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:159985,0.9945559501647948,0.9478896260261536,0.3698008060455322,0.0021366460714489,0.0021917847916483,0.0037158066406846,0.0027370085008442,0.9904906749725342,0.47874915599823,0.6419726610183716,0.0282962117344141,0.193197026848793,0.0094521921128034,0.0024955642875283,0.0256076622754335,0.0028330360073596,0.7087327837944031,Decent Work and Economic Growth,"Aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."
8,"When work disappears: manufacturing decline and the falling marriage-market value of men
The structure of marriage and child-rearing in U.S. households has undergone two marked shifts in the last three decades: a steep decline in the prevalence of marriage among young adults, and a sharp rise in the fraction of children born to unmarried mothers or living in single-headed households. A potential contributor to both phenomena is the declining labor-market opportunities faced by males, which make them less valuable as marital partners. We exploit large scale, plausibly exogenous labor-demand shocks stemming from rising international manufacturing competition to test how shifts in the supply of young ‘marriageable’ males affect marriage, fertility and children's living circumstances. Trade shocks to manufacturing industries have differentially negative impacts on the labor market prospects of men and degrade their marriage-market value along multiple dimensions: diminishing their relative earnings—particularly at the lower segment of the distribution—reducing their physical availability in trade-impacted labor markets, and increasing their participation in risky and damaging behaviors. As predicted by a simple model of marital decision-making under uncertainty, we document that adverse shocks to the supply of `marriageable' men reduce the prevalence of marriage and lower fertility but raise the fraction of children born to young and unwed mothers and living in in poor single-parent households. The falling marriage-market value of young men appears to be a quantitatively important contributor to the rising rate of out-of-wedlock childbearing and single-headed childrearing in the United States.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:138938,0.9947102069854736,0.4189854860305786,0.8738435506820679,0.0275282487273216,0.9856077432632446,0.0032442794181406,0.0021854306105524,0.9914507269859314,0.896533191204071,0.7562195658683777,0.0317146778106689,0.0047534289769828,0.0039878687821328,0.0033390182070434,0.0079657584428787,0.9162718653678894,0.8568623065948486,Decent Work and Economic Growth,"Aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."
8,"Sovereign debt sustainability in advanced economies
We develop a measure of maximum sustainable government debt for advanced economies. How much investors are willing to lend to a country's government depends on how high a primary surplus they expect that government to generate, how fast they expect the country to grow, how volatile they expect that growth to be, and how much debt they expect the government will be able to raise in the future for the purpose of servicing the debt it seeks to raise today. This last observation points to the presence of a borrowing multiplier, which raises a country's borrowing well above what it would be, absent the ability to service maturing debt out of new debt's proceeds. Present debt is sustainable when implied future debt remains bounded. A country's probability of default displays a marked asymmetry around that country's maximum sustainable debt (MSD): it increases slowly below and rapidly above. We calibrate our measure for 23 OECD countries: Korea has the highest MSD at 281% of GDP and Greece the lowest at 89%. The probabilities of default at MSD are very low, from Norway's 0.27% to Korea's 0.81%. Most countries' actual debt-to-GDP ratios in 2010 are below MSD; some countries are above; these are generally the countries that have received some form of financial support in the wake of the financial crisis.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:111097,0.0323688574135303,0.031496275216341,0.0051585929468274,0.0042790211737155,0.0023585753515362,0.0022405034396797,0.0019688678439706,0.9914074540138244,0.7600562572479248,0.2710151374340057,0.039112951606512,0.5354800224304199,0.0175455883145332,0.0025494932197034,0.8962361216545105,0.0921940058469772,0.9886793494224548,Decent Work and Economic Growth,"Aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."

We study the deterioration of employment in middle-wage, routine occupations in the United States in the last 35 years. The decline is primarily driven by changes in the propen- sity to work in routine jobs for individuals from a small set of demographic groups. These same groups account for a substantial fraction of both the increase in non-employment and employment in low-wage, non-routine manual occupations observed during the same period. We analyze a general neoclassical model of the labor market featuring endogenous participation and occupation choice. In response to an increase in automation technology, the framework embodies a tradeoffbetween reallocating employment across occupations and reallocation of workers towards non-employment. Quantitatively, we find that this standard model accounts for a relatively small portion of the joint decline in routine em- ployment and associated rise in non-routine manual employment and non-employment.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:145755,0.34525066614151,0.0095189874991774,0.0089775174856185,0.0219863858073949,0.032030813395977,0.0020930236205458,0.0023646722547709,0.9919843077659608,0.8057776093482971,0.8574256896972656,0.0284100547432899,0.0041585355065763,0.0037059728056192,0.0021560059394687,0.0054240459576249,0.0104699563235044,0.1036900505423545,Decent Work and Economic Growth,"Aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."

We find that the spillover effects are small for all countries in our sample, ranging from a cumulative real income loss of at most −0.2% to a cumulative real income gain of at most 0.2%.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:136051,0.9874160885810852,0.0202585291117429,0.0109514854848384,0.0046216296032071,0.0021706479601562,0.0044431937858462,0.0019514700397849,0.9917898178100586,0.9060468673706056,0.96077960729599,0.0442991033196449,0.2381840050220489,0.0036058020778,0.0024327880237251,0.0051075248047709,0.0028658339288085,0.9613791704177856,Decent Work and Economic Growth,"Aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."

8,"Marginal jobs and job surplus: a test of the efficiency of separations
We present a sharp test for the efficiency of job separations. First, we document a dramatic increase in the separation rate – 11.2ppt (28%) over five years – in response to a quasi-experimental extension of UI benefit duration for older workers. Second, after the abolition of the policy, the ""job survivors"" in the formerly treated group exhibit exactly the same separation behavior as the control group. Juxtaposed, these facts reject the ""Coasean"" prediction of efficient separations, whereby the UI extensions should have extracted marginal (low-surplus) jobs and thereby rendered the remaining (high-surplus) jobs more resilient after its abolition. Third, we show that a formal model of predicted efficient separations implies a piece-wise linear function of the actual control group separations beyond the missing mass of marginal matches. A structural estimation reveals point estimates of the share of efficient separations below 4%, with confidence intervals rejecting shares above 13%. Fourth, to characterize the marginal jobs in the data, we extend complier analysis to difference-in-difference settings such as ours. The UI-indiced separators stemmed from declining firms, blue-collar jobs, with a high share of sick older workers, and firms more likely to have works councils – while their wages were similar to program survivors. The evidence is consistent with a ""non-Coasean"" framework building on wage frictions preventing efficient bargaining, and with formal or informal institutional constraints on selective separations.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:162794,0.0037779822014272,0.0118828192353248,0.0050823339261114,0.0019640435930341,0.0605641305446624,0.0019053203286603,0.0024218754842877,0.9918377995491028,0.8414260745048523,0.9839774966239928,0.5633135437965393,0.0038547446019947,0.0038638201076537,0.0028517462778836,0.006366791203618,0.8153436779975891,0.0827408507466316,Decent Work and Economic Growth,"Aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all."
9,"Studying the internet and violent conflict
The role of the Internet in contemporary violent conflicts is receiving increasing scholarly attention. In this article, I review some of the pioneering studies that investigate how the emergence and penetration of modern communication technology across the world influences violent conflicts. Building on these important findings, I propose four entry points for future research. First, research on the link between the Internet and violent conflict needs to account for the profound changes the Internet has undergone in past decades, as well as the extent to which its nature is becoming increasingly endogenous to local contexts. Second, little is currently known about the effects of communication technology in violent conflict that move beyond initial mobilization. Third, architectural and algorithmic designs of social media platforms heavily influence the possibilities and constraints of human interactions on the Internet, but to date remain understudied. Fourth, further studies are needed to understand how the Internet has changed how violent conflict is communicated and portrayed both online and offline.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:144618,0.003924642689526,0.0080075459554791,0.025567203760147,0.3031224608421325,0.0060801701620221,0.0017069734167307,0.0027085696347057,0.0549496300518512,0.8725622892379761,0.1460882872343063,0.9332192540168762,0.0038566419389098,0.0035347924567759,0.0024271553847938,0.0121692242100834,0.9954749941825868,0.172504723072052,"Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure","Aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation."

9,"The future of online content personalisation: Technology, law and digital freedoms
As online information is increasingly tailored, or “personalised”, to the user, it has been praised by some as a pragmatic response to information overload, while criticised by others as creating an echo chamber that threatens deliberative democracy. The unsettling question is whether the latest wave of innovation in online content personalisation technologies has shifted decision-making power from humans to computers. The paper argues that a thorough understanding of personalisation technologies is necessary to critically evaluate their normative effect and impact on social values. It reflects on the differences between regulation by code and regulation by law, exploring how code affects individual and social autonomies, and considering whether meta-rules regulating code are appropriate.

9,"Bottom-up constitutionalism: The case of net neutrality
Net neutrality is no longer only a battle cry of a few Internet romancers but has evolved into a key value for contemporary society that is being institutionalised as a constitutional right. With the help of sociological systems theory, this text argues that the social and legal institutionalisation of constitutional rights need to be distinguished. Commonly, constitutional rights emerge from society before they are reformulated in the legal realm. Using the example of the United States, the paper shows empirically that net neutrality is about to emerge as a new fundamental value and right. Its constitutionalisation is happening bottom-up, driven by social movements, Internet activists and advocacy groups, and further, in an interweavement of civil society dynamics with the legal system. The question is whether constitutional structures have already become identifiable. The last section discusses the relationship between social and formal constitutional structures from a legitimacy and democracy perspective.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:136370,0.0052382624708116,0.0897519364953041,0.0286545809358358,0.1202077567577362,0.0130039239302277,0.0034563243389129,0.0026434636674821,0.0272771157324314,0.0196120180189609,0.9887049794197084,0.0264843627810478,0.0039252541027963,0.0035305677447468,0.0042689782567322,0.0107351578772068,0.9955503940582277,0.0717448890209198,"Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure","Aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation."
9,"Freedom and affordances of the net
This article is about the relationship between technology and society in fundamental rights theory. So far, the discussion about law and technology has generally been one-directional within the most relevant branches of the social sciences; scholars of the law have been treating technology as a black box when conducting their analyses or developing their theories. In turn, science and technology studies have considered law and regulation as a closed book, which is unsatisfactory as well. Reductionist and compartmentalized theorizing is particularly problematic when it comes to conceiving a fundamental rights theory that is able to cope with challenges of the Internet. Guided by Niklas Luhmann’s autopoietic systems theory, this Article offers novel perspectives that aim at theoretically explaining how affordances can be conceptualized within constitutional rights theory, with the focus on the freedom of the Internet.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:142603,0.0038065314292907,0.0592208765447139,0.0092830210924148,0.0275515653192996,0.0043174745514988,0.0161080285906791,0.0021937713027,0.4728738367557525,0.9104321599006652,0.7806112170219421,0.0193513315171003,0.0053516174666583,0.003321394091472,0.0038705985061824,0.0095022721216082,0.9946107864379884,0.162162184715271,"Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure","Aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation."
9,"Long-term relationships: static gains and dynamic inefficiencies
In the 1980s the Japanese “keiretsu” system of interconnected business groups was praised as a model to emulate, but since then Japan has often been criticized for being less innovative than the United States. In this paper we connect the two views and argue that tight business relationships can create dynamic inefficiencies and reduce broad innovations. In particular, we consider the repeated interaction between final good producers and intermediate input suppliers, where the provision of the intermediate input is noncontractible. We build a cooperative equilibrium where producers can switch suppliers and start cooperation immediately with new suppliers. We first consider broad innovations: every period, one supplier has the opportunity to create a higher quality input that can be used by all producers. Since relationships are harder to break in the cooperative equilibrium the market size for potential innovators is smaller and the rate of innovation might be lower than in the noncooperative equilibrium. We contrast this with a setting with relationship-specific innovations that we show are encouraged by the establishment of relational contracts. We illustrate the predictions of the model using the recent business history of the United States and Japan and further use patent data to show that U.S. patents are more general than Japanese and even more so in sectors using more differentiated inputs.

Next, using instrumental variable analysis, we argue that these correlations at least partly reflect a causality from innovation to top income shares.

9,"Unintended side effects of the digital transition: European scientists’ messages from a proposition-based expert round table
We present the main messages of a European Expert Round Table (ERT) on the unintended side effects (unseens ) of the digital transition. Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated communalities and relationships among these unseens  and provided suggestions on (i) what the major unseens  are; (ii) how rebound effects of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research; and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary theory and practice processes for developing socially robust orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the “ownership, economic value, use and access of data” and, related to this, algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the human–environment relationship resulted in the following greater picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor, democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor, and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism. Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens  in this field call for special attention, research and management. Related to the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity), the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character of the human being (i.e., humanity).

9,"Identifying promising objectives for a sustainable HCI pattern language
Sustainable HCI can still be considered a relatively young field; yet, it has seen a variety of recent contributions investigating previous approaches and raising questions on how to go forward. As such, the field would greatly benefit from an effort to summarize existing solutions, avoiding reinventing the wheel but also identifying blank spots of missing research. Design patterns offer such an approach. Established in the domain of architecture, successfully utilized to date in software engineering, and having been applied to a variety of areas in HCI, design patterns have a rich history from which the SHCI community can learn and use it to its advantage. We examine previous approaches of design patterns and based on those insights lay out a set of challenges and opportunities for their application to SHCI.

9,"Tailoring sustainable HCI design knowledge to design practice
The field of Sustainable HCI has grown significantly in recent years, yielding a great body of knowledge about sustainable interaction design. However, this knowledge has led to a similar outcome to many other theoretical contributions in the broader domain of HCI: there are only few examples of its direct application to practice. We looked at design research literature from outside of HCI and gathered insights about the work practice of real-world designers to help uncover potential barriers to transferal. In order to increase acceptance and applicability of Sustainable HCI design knowledge for design practice, we argue that Sustainable HCI researchers have to tailor their theoretical contributions to the application domain’s practices in order to reach a broader audience and achieve higher impact.

9,"The literature on the effects of research and development
The economic return to public and private R&D is of enormous interest to academics and policy makers. First, private returns to R&D appear to be large and larger than the returns to alternative investments. Second, private R&D and R&D subsidies are positively correlated and there is no evidence for crowding out effects. Third, R&D cooperation increases private R&D. Fourth, there appear to exist complementarities between alternative sources of funding. Fifth, the mobility of R&D workers, particularly of university scientists is positively related to an increase in innovation. Sixth, there are many university spinoffs but these are no more successful than non-university spinoffs. Seventh, scientists with a migration background outperform domestic ones. Eights, universities constitute important collaboration partners. Ninth, clusters enhance collaboration, patents and productivity.

There has been a long overdue revival of interest recently amongst economic and development geographersin questions of geographical uneven development. On the one hand, this can be seen as a reaction to thepositive emphasis during the 1990s on the inclusion of firms, workers and regions in global value chains andproduction networks. On the other hand, there has been a growing awareness of the continuing importanceof agriculture and the question of agrarian change, not least after the development industry had rediscoveredsmallholders and peasants as targets of market-driven policy interventions.

10,"Rights for same-sex couples and public attitudes toward gays and lesbians in Europe
This article investigates how changes in same-sex rights affect attitudes toward homosexuality. We argue that different same-sex relationship policies vary in their impact. Whereas registered partnership laws construct a distinct target population that receives new benefits, marriage equality sends an unambiguously positive signal and reduces the perceived group difference through inclusion into existing rights. As a consequence, marriage equality should have a positive effect on attitudes toward homosexuality, whereas partnership laws should have much less positive effects and could even lead to backlash among some groups. Combining data from eight waves of the European Social Survey with data on legislation, we analyze the effects of same-sex marriage, registered partnerships, and marriage bans on attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Marriage has a positive effect, bans and registered partnerships have a negative effect. Legalized partnership is especially associated with significantly more negative attitudes among nonreligious and less educated people.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170674,0.0036497528199106,0.0766127556562423,0.0890440866351127,0.3129307925701141,0.9956454038619996,0.0020682918839156,0.0023057227954268,0.1851757168769836,0.0091880001127719,0.9948651194572448,0.0136874560266733,0.0048401220701634,0.0035616438835859,0.0031915272120386,0.0094455871731042,0.8687750101089478,0.979478359222412,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.
10,"How immigration reforms affect voting behavior
This article investigates how changes in immigration policies affect migration as a vote-defining issue at upcoming elections. So far, the literature on issue voting has mostly focused on the role of issue entrepreneurs in politicizing new issues. In this article, however, we introduce policy change as a new potential determinant in the process of issue evolution. Moreover, in contrast to most of the literature that investigates the role of policy outcomes (such as economic growth or unemployment) on voting decisions, we analyze the effect of laws which can be directly attributed to governments and political parties. We focus on within-country variation and analyze national election surveys from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany between 1994 and 2011. These surveys include information on both self- and party-placements regarding immigration issues. To measure policy changes, we use data on immigration policies from the newly built Immigration Policies in Comparison dataset. While we expect a general reform effect, we investigate in more detail whether liberal and restrictive reforms have a similar effect on votes for left/right, government/opposition parties. It is shown that both liberal and restrictive reforms lead to increasing issue voting. While we show that government parties are not more affected than opposition parties, we see that party ideology partly plays a role.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:156942,0.0037873336113989,0.0394991338253021,0.0211755651980638,0.029282484203577,0.193704068660736,0.0033017427194863,0.0024518833961337,0.9707382917404176,0.1945894211530685,0.9946581721305848,0.148845374584198,0.0044162143021821,0.3141260147094726,0.0040408782660961,0.0077410517260432,0.9861987829208374,0.2805197536945343,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.
10,"Direct and indirect predictors of opposition to immigration in Europe: individual values, cultural values, and symbolic threat
The current study examines the following questions: (1) the extent to which individual basic human values are linked with attitudes towards immigration; (2) whether symbolic threat by immigration mediates this relation; and (3) whether cultural values moderate the relations between individual values, threat, and attitudes towards immigration. The empirical analysis relies on the 2014/2015 data from the immigration module of the European Social Survey (ESS) for West and East European countries. We find that universalistic individuals expressed lower threat due to immigration and higher support of immigration while conservative individuals displayed the opposite pattern. Symbolic threat mediated the association between values and immigration attitudes, but in most countries the mediation was partial. The associations between values, symbolic threat, and attitudes towards immigration were stronger in countries characterised by higher levels of intellectual and affective autonomy and weaker in countries characterised by higher levels of cultural embeddedness. The findings provide support for the centrality of human values in the formation of threat and attitudes towards immigration.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168913,0.0038304927293211,0.1087826043367385,0.0307437181472778,0.0506462752819061,0.1280865520238876,0.003907190170139,0.0022156399209052,0.4346210956573486,0.2103887945413589,0.9950746893882751,0.0486273877322673,0.0039655365981161,0.003575473325327,0.0051979073323309,0.0118361422792077,0.9179452657699584,0.0955986157059669,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.
10,"Economic conditions, group relative deprivation and ethnic threat perceptions: a cross-national perspective
Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168915,0.0076401634141802,0.0479004755616188,0.0093244705349206,0.0304405353963375,0.0657424703240394,0.0041244053281843,0.0021869014017283,0.7390931248664856,0.3272431194782257,0.9953574538230896,0.0629101023077964,0.0041183200664818,0.0039482712745666,0.0044191940687596,0.0064193406142294,0.8648642301559448,0.2747047841548919,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.

10,"Aid fragmentation and effectiveness: what do we really know?
Aid fragmentation is widely recognized as being detrimental to development outcomes. We reinvestigate the impact of fragmentation in the context of growth, bureaucratic policy, and education, focusing on a number of conceptually different indicators of fragmentation, and paying attention to potentially heterogeneous effects across countries, sectors, and channels of influence. Our systematic and detailed reexamination of existing empirical studies shows that this differentiation is crucial. In some sectors—such as primary education—donor concentration or limiting donor numbers appear to be detrimental rather than beneficial for development outcomes. In other areas, we find the expected negative effect, but only when we conceptualize fragmentation as a lack of lead donors (too limited concentration), rather than in terms of donor numbers. In all cases, sufficient initial administrative capacity in recipient countries prevents the negative and reinforces the positive effects of fragmentation. This stresses the importance of questioning the sweeping conclusions drawn by much of the previous literature. Based on what we currently know, generalizing judgments about the effect of aid fragmentation may be misleading.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:144206,0.0036257056053727,0.0108022997155785,0.0149387400597333,0.9715465903282166,0.0026134306099265,0.0062465495429933,0.0026037797797471,0.8519262671470642,0.8338610529899597,0.9357846975326538,0.1160969957709312,0.0041315639391541,0.0037594942841678,0.0038853141013532,0.0047032781876623,0.9104913473129272,0.9863925576210022,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.

We analyse the patterns of multi-bi aid in the European Union. Using newly available multi-bi aid data and a large number of staff interviews at the European Commission, the World Bank and bilateral donors, we draw three conclusions. First, the Commission's capacity constraints and lack of specific expertise have prevented it from becoming an important host of trust funds like other international development organizations. Second, the same capacity constraints can generally explain its extensive participation in trust funds at other international development organizations. In the case of large global funds, however, Commission participation often reflects the outcome of member state politics. Third, once the Commission delegates its aid to multilateral agencies, it does not impose strong substantive earmarking, but requires a high level of legal and administrative controls.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:144773,0.0038276242557913,0.0370620302855968,0.0111234867945313,0.0133090317249298,0.0061923060566186,0.0018954012775793,0.0024323747493326,0.1886038035154342,0.7138250470161438,0.8602669835090637,0.1721360981464386,0.0038206812459975,0.0034673127811402,0.0023041723761707,0.0056219049729406,0.9957932233810424,0.9889784455299376,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.
10,"Was bedeutet es, die Autonomie anderer zu respektieren?
To respect the autonomous choices of persons is an important moral principle. There is, however, little agreement about its nature and its normative importance. This is due to the fact that the concept of autonomy as well as the moral relevance of autonomy are contested. It is argued in this paper that the debate about autonomy is at its core a debate about the reasons for respecting decisions. Decisions of persons are to be respected as their decisions, and they have to be respected as determining the deontic properties of situations. This, however, can only be understood against the background of persons having rights over themselves. Their decisions determine the deontic properties as exercises of their rights. Thus, respect for the autonomous choice of persons turns out to be respect for their rights.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:134491,0.0156397949904203,0.010889028199017,0.0315687023103237,0.0877452194690704,0.5503355264663696,0.0053677284158766,0.0447462014853954,0.1641591936349868,0.0244933273643255,0.929408311843872,0.0603228956460952,0.0099208243191242,0.0230930130928754,0.0069388481788337,0.024977121502161,0.995991051197052,0.2755278944969177,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.
10,"Deliberative inclusion of minorities: patterns of reciprocity among linguistic groups in Switzerland
We present a model of deliberative inclusion, focusing on reciprocity in the interaction between structural minorities/disadvantaged groups and majorities/privileged groups. Our model, however, comes with a ‘friendly amendment’: we have put the ‘burden of reciprocity’ mainly on majorities and privileged groups. It is mainly their obligation to seriously listen and respond to the demands and arguments of minorities and disadvantaged groups and show a willingness to respect and accommodate these interests. Empirically, we apply our model to the interaction of linguistic groups in the Swiss parliament.

10,"The comparability of measurements of attitudes toward immigration in the European Social Survey: exact versus approximate measurement equivalence
International survey datasets are analyzed with increasing frequency to investigate and compare attitudes toward immigration and to examine the contextual factors that shape these attitudes. However, international comparisons of abstract, psychological constructs require the measurements to be equivalent–i.e., they should measure the same concept on the same measurement scale. Traditional approaches to assessing measurement equivalence quite often
lead to the conclusion that measurements are cross-nationally incomparable but have been criticized for being overly strict. In the current study, we present an alternative Bayesian approach that assesses whether measurements are approximately (rather than exactly)
equivalent. This approach allows small variations in measurement parameters across groups.
Taking a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis framework as a starting point, this study applies approximate and exact equivalence tests to the anti-immigration attitudes scale that was implemented in the European Social Survey (ESS). Measurement equivalence is tested across the full set of 271,220 individuals in 35 ESS countries over six rounds. The results of the exact and the approximate approaches are quite different. Approximate scalar measurement equivalence is established in all ESS rounds, thus allowing researchers to meaningfully compare these mean scores and their relationships with other theoretical constructs of interest. The exact approach, however, eventually proves to be overly strict and leads to the conclusion that measurements are incomparable for a large number of countries and time points.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:110767,0.0038509690202772,0.0858101695775985,0.013736143708229,0.1187268942594528,0.2923456728458404,0.0046861041337251,0.0022011590190231,0.4259544909000397,0.6595342755317688,0.9950313568115234,0.0620731860399246,0.0041320663876831,0.0034227916039526,0.0054680863395333,0.0077470391988754,0.8947288990020752,0.5150771141052246,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.

The incentives of political agents to enforce tax collection are key determinants of the levels of compliance. We study the electoral response to the Ghost Buildings program, a nationwide anti tax evasion policy in Italy that used innovative monitoring technologies to target buildings hidden from tax authorities. The program induced monetary and non-monetary benefits for non-evaders and an increase in local government expenditures. A one standard deviation increase in town-level program intensity leads to a 4.8% increase in local incumbent reelection rates. In addition, these political returns are higher in areas with lower tax evasion tolerance and with higher efficiency of public good provision, implying complementarity among enforcement policies, the underlying tax culture, and the quality of the government.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:127519,0.003998078405857,0.0076931421644985,0.008057995699346,0.0021467632614076,0.002493466483429,0.0018607776146382,0.0022082543000578,0.0686877220869064,0.8328194618225098,0.4572981595993042,0.9231985807418824,0.0043260967358946,0.0073809404857456,0.0020426227711141,0.0067239538766443,0.8442786335945129,0.8874596953392029,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.

10,"Changing cultural attitudes towards female genital cutting
As globalization brings people with incompatible attitudes into contact, cultural conflicts inevitably arise. Little is known about how to mitigate conflict and about how the conflicts that occur can shape the cultural evolution of the groups involved. Female genital cutting is a prominent example1, 2, 3. Governments and international agencies have promoted the abandonment of cutting for decades, but the practice remains widespread with associated health risks for millions of girls and women4, 5. In their efforts to end cutting, international agents have often adopted the view that cutting is locally pervasive and entrenched1. This implies the need to introduce values and expectations from outside the local culture. Members of the target society may view such interventions as unwelcome intrusions1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and campaigns promoting abandonment have sometimes led to backlash1, 7, 8, 10, 11 as they struggle to reconcile cultural tolerance with the conviction that cutting violates universal human rights1, 9. Cutting, however, is not necessarily locally pervasive and entrenched1, 3, 12. We designed experiments on cultural change that exploited the existence of conflicting attitudes within cutting societies. We produced four entertaining movies that served as experimental treatments in two experiments in Sudan, and we developed an implicit association test to unobtrusively measure attitudes about cutting. The movies depart from the view that cutting is locally pervasive by dramatizing members of an extended family as they confront each other with divergent views about whether the family should continue cutting. The movies significantly improved attitudes towards girls who remain uncut, with one in particular having a relatively persistent effect. These results show that using entertainment to dramatize locally discordant views can provide a basis for applied cultural evolution without accentuating intercultural divisions.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:127523,0.0090459967032074,0.0505888611078262,0.8001849055290222,0.1281048208475113,0.9950147271156312,0.0021711911540478,0.0022923017386347,0.1059431582689285,0.0841794982552528,0.334437608718872,0.0401798747479915,0.0044905175454914,0.0041582575067877,0.0076466049067676,0.0092882104218006,0.927328884601593,0.3223935067653656,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.

We investigate the suitability of securitization as an alternative to reinsurance for the purpose of transferring natural catastrophe risk. We characterize the conditions under which one or the other form of risk transfer dominates using a setting in which reinsurers and traders in financial markets produce costly information about catastrophes. Such information is useful to insurers: along with the information produced by insurers themselves, it reduces insurers’ costly capital requirements.

Are Islamic banks inherently more stable than conventional banks? We address this question by applying a survival analysis based on the Cox proportional hazard model to a comprehensive sample of 421 banks in 20 Middle and Far Eastern countries from 1995 to 2010. By comparing the failure risk for both bank types, we find that Islamic banks have a significantly lower risk of failure than that of their conventional peers. This lower risk is based both unconditionally and conditionally on bank-specific (microeconomic) variables as well as macroeconomic and market structure variables.

Does the presence of immigrants in one's neighborhood affect voting for far right-wing parties? We study the case of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) that, under the leadership of Jörg Haider, increased its vote share from less than 5% in the early 1980s to 27% by the end of the 1990s and continued to attract more than 20% of voters in the 2013 national election. We find that the inflow of immigrants into a community has a significant impact on the increase in the community's voting share for the FPÖ, explaining roughly a tenth of the regional variation in vote changes. Our results suggest that voters worry about adverse labor market effects of immigration, as well as about the quality of their neighborhood. In fact, we find evidence of a negative impact of immigration on “compositional amenities”.

External financing of local public goods can potentially create ‘political resource curses' by reducing citizen oversight, exacerbating elite capture, and producing policy outcomes that are sub-optimal for the general population. This paper experimentally tests a novel mechanism that seeks to mitigate elite capture of local development projects. Control communities are provided with block grants to fund local public goods, while households in treatment communities are provided with vouchers that they may either contribute to a public good or redeem at a discount for a private capital good. We find that the use of vouchers as a mechanism for aid delivery increases community participation in local public decision-making, changes the nature of allocation outcomes, and improves community satisfaction with allocation outcomes.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168871,0.7750739455223083,0.0221471488475799,0.0059931785799562,0.0022955385502427,0.0026136939413845,0.0030623874627053,0.0022674568463116,0.968622624874115,0.4196689426898956,0.8820802569389343,0.5871039628982544,0.2956220209598541,0.0037535466253757,0.7016156911849976,0.0051489183679223,0.9943693280220032,0.9871755242347716,Reduced Inequalities,Aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.

We incorporate consumption indivisibilities into the Krugman (1980) model and show that an importer's per capita income becomes a primary determinant of “export zeros”. Households in the rich North (poor South) are willing to pay high (low) prices for consumer goods; hence, unconstrained monopoly pricing generates arbitrage opportunities for internationally traded products. Export zeros arise because some northern firms abstain from exporting to the South, to avoid international arbitrage. Rich countries benefit from a trade liberalization, while poor countries lose. These results hold also under more general preferences with both extensive and intensive consumption margins. We show that a standard calibrated trade model (that ignores arbitrage) generates predictions on relative prices that violate no-arbitrage constraints in many bilateral trade relations.

11,"Impacts of urban sprawl on species richness of plants, butterflies, gastropods and birds: not only built-up area matters
Urban growth is a major factor of global environmental change and has important impacts on biodiversity, such as changes in species composition and biotic homogenization.
Most previous studies have focused on effects of urban area as a general measure of urbanization, and on few or single taxa. Here, we analyzed the impacts of the different components of urban sprawl (i.e., scattered and widespread urban growth) on species richness of a variety of taxonomic groups covering mosses, vascular plants, gastropods, butterflies, and birds at the habitat and landscape scales. Besides urban area, we considered the average age,imperviousness, and dispersion degree of urban area, along with human population density, to disentangle the effects of the different components of urban sprawl on biodiversity. The study was carried out in the Swiss Plateau that has undergone substantial urban sprawl in recent decades.
Vascular plants and birds showed the strongest responses to urban sprawl, especially at the landscape scale, with non-native and ruderal plants proliferating and common generalist birds increasing at the expense of specialist birds as urban sprawl grew. Overall, urban area had the greatest contribution on such impacts, but additional effects of urban dispersion (i.e., increase of non-native plants) and human population density (i.e., increases of ruderal plants and common generalist birds) were found. Our findings support the hypothesis that negative impacts of urban sprawl on biodiversity can be reduced by compacting urban growth while still avoiding the formation of very densely populated areas.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:123659,0.0039210370741784,0.0280652195215225,0.0115418117493391,0.0018710740841925,0.0021466559264808,0.0124963475391268,0.0021320080850273,0.0123011106625199,0.0087159015238285,0.0150474067777395,0.9893194437026978,0.0410798452794551,0.0038286773487925,0.136086955666542,0.613468587398529,0.002838012529537,0.0092413164675235,Sustainable Cities and Communities,"Aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."

The results indicate that the production route should start with carrot pomace, use heat and solvent recovery, and deactivate the enzymes with bleach instead of heat. To further improve the process, the results show that focus should be laid on the carrier polymer, sodium alginate, and the production of the GripX coating.

12,"Environmental assessment of alternative methanesulfonic acid production using direct activation of methane
In this paper we present a comparative life cycle assessment of two processes for the industrial production of methansulfonic acid. The conventional multi-step process for the production of methansulfonic acid is based on the reaction of methanol and hydrogen sulfide to form methanthiol which is used to produce dimethyldisulfate. The dimethyldisulfate reacts further with nitric acid to form methanesulfonic acid. A newly developed process presents the possibility to form methanesulfonic acid directly from methane and sulfur trioxide in a single step at mild conditions. Thus this process enables for the first time the production of a high value chemical through direct activation of methane on an industrial scale. The cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment conducted with the ReCiPe Method revealed that this direct process has a total environmental impact that is 3 times lower than that of the conventional process. The differences resulted from lower energy requirements and alternative reactants used in the direct process. The results therefore demonstrate the potential for methane extracted from natural gas as a greener alternative to oil as a chemical feedstock in the medium term.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157157,0.0039496421813964,0.0855033174157142,0.0477054491639137,0.0019368438515812,0.0021879619453102,0.8288740515708923,0.9447629451751708,0.0069308523088693,0.9708667397499084,0.003684154478833,0.0344852954149246,0.9912437200546264,0.0043707694858312,0.0315613262355327,0.7046957015991211,0.0031964140944182,0.0098814833909273,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"Multi-perspective application selection: a method to identify sustainable applications for new materials using the example of cellulose nanofiber reinforced composites
To date, technical and economic criteria have become the main benchmarks used in assessing the substitution potential of new materials. Sustainable product design uses multi-criteria decision methods to select the best material or process from a set of alternatives, requiring that the target product is already known. This paper follows a contrary approach by introducing the Multi-Perspective Application Selection, a method to support researchers and industrial practitioners alike in identifying and choosing the most promising and sustainable applications for new materials under development. This is achieved through combining and assessing technical, economic and environmental criteria covering the entire life cycle of an application. With this method, numerous possible applications can be screened during the early stages of material development when little information is available. The results help to narrow the selection of feasible products by excluding unpromising applications. The first step involves identifying and segmenting potential markets. In the second step, technical and economic aspects are assessed by employing user acceptance criteria. Finally, simplified life cycle assessment calculations are implemented in the third step to cover environmental considerations.

12,"It's not easy being green : why voters punish parties for environmental policies during economic downturns
Recent scholarship asserts the existence of “luxury goods voting” arguing that voters penalize parties associated with post-material issues or those with long-run payoffs during economic downturns. We test this arguments here using data from four election studies in Denmark and Germany that explicitly ask respondents to rate parties on one particular luxury goods issue: protection of the environment. Voters who perceive the economy as weak indeed punish governing parties more severely when they associate them with environmental policies; conversely, a green reputation when the economy is expanding garners left-wing parties higher vote probabilities. Right-wing governing parties fare similarly, benefitting from those who perceive them as green when the economy is hale, albeit only converging to the vote probabilities awarded from voters who see them as less green when the economy sours.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:143184,0.0034702320117503,0.0332634374499321,0.0051087629981338,0.2903436422348022,0.0052678463980555,0.0028372865635901,0.0021505469921976,0.0980277210474014,0.1785419285297393,0.8113235831260681,0.0587308295071125,0.4799889326095581,0.3942746520042419,0.0021683799568563,0.7994698882102966,0.8715606927871704,0.0674680545926094,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"How Political is Political Consumption? The Case of Activism for the Global South and Fair Trade
Political consumption is a flourishing field of research at the intersection of consumer research and political sociology. Political consumption means the consideration of ethical or political motives in the decision to buy certain products. Its main forms are the buying (buycott) of products distinguished by certain ethical or political characteristics such as sustainability, social justice, or corporate responsibility, and the boycott of products that lack such characteristics. However, there is an ongoing discussion about the status of political consumption. Some authors suspect that it may distract citizens from more challenging forms of participation (crowding-out thesis). In contrast, most empirical research has shown that political consumers are also more active than the general population in other forms of political participation. However, this has only been shown for fairly general measures of political consumption and participation. Our contribution to this debate thus focuses on one specific form of political consumption and corresponding forms of participation: activism for the Global South and fair trade consumption, zooming in on the case of Switzerland, where fair trade consumption is quite widespread within the population. Our results show that fair trade consumption is only weakly related to other forms of engagement for Global South issues, thus it does not distract from more challenging forms of engagement, but it is also not part of a more general engaged lifestyle. This is supported by the fact that the motivations and structural underpinnings of other forms of activism for the Global South differ from those of fair trade consumption.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:149191,0.0037428059149533,0.0603515952825546,0.0238021705299615,0.0068686744198203,0.0048144566826522,0.0029962612316012,0.0025393639225512,0.3927184045314789,0.3298233449459076,0.925038516521454,0.0333280973136425,0.5113513469696045,0.0036384579725563,0.0047191125340759,0.7587699294090271,0.9045997858047484,0.8274768590927124,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"Between fragmentation and dialogue: Twitter communities and political debate about the Swiss “Nuclear Withdrawal Initiative”
As social media sites have become significant arenas for political debate in recent years, this paper investigates the political debate that took place on Twitter in the wake of the Swiss referendum on the Nuclear Withdrawal Initiative, which was conducted in November 2016. Using Twitter data of 3000 users, we could identify 7 distinct communities that varied in terms of their size, position, and contribution to the debate. The most dominant communities in the debate were the Conservative Mainstream and the Green-Left communities. Moreover, our findings show that communities supporting and opposing the initiative differ with regard to the wording they use in their tweets. Finally, our results reveal an active exchange both within and, even more importantly, between the communities, which indicates a rather pluralistic and internally connected debate. Thus, our findings clearly contrast with those of prior studies concerning political debates on social media that identified pronounced echo chambers.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:159664,0.0037631411105394,0.0102530717849731,0.1032290160655975,0.1943411231040954,0.0079001942649483,0.0021679631900042,0.0044340598396956,0.04397639259696,0.067755676805973,0.9936548471450806,0.1372626721858978,0.0751609429717063,0.6742282509803772,0.003445123322308,0.0119364811107516,0.8495069742202759,0.3931919038295746,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"Audience segments in environmental and science communication: recent findings and future perspectives
People differ. Not only do they vote for different parties, buy different products, have different hobbies and use different media. They also differ in their interest in, attitudes on, and behavior towards scientific and environmental issues. This has been shown for people’s general assessments of environmental issues (e.g. Eurobarometer, 2017) and of science and research (for an overview see Besley, 2013). It has also been demonstrated for people’s attitudes towards more specific topics such as global warming (for an overview see Nisbet & Myers, 2007), nuclear energy (e.g. Kristiansen, Bonfadelli, & Kovic, 2016), nanotechnology (e.g. Scheufele, Corley, Shih, Dalrymple, & Ho, 2009), or biotechnology (e.g. Bonfadelli, 2017). These differences are not randomly distributed across populations. Researchers from the social and behavioral sciences have identified the organizing logics that underlie this diversity, and identified factors which help explain the variation of people’s attitudes. They have shown, for example, that perceptual and behavioral differences with regards to scientific and environmental issues are related to people’s education, their age, gender, or socio-economic status, among other factors (see, e.g. Besley, 2013; Kawamoto, Nakayama, & Saijo, 2013; Nisbet & Myers, 2007; Research Councils UK, 2008).",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:159677,0.0041869510896503,0.0196538288146257,0.0101743200793862,0.857062578201294,0.9843485951423644,0.0087170852348208,0.5365649461746216,0.0156013173982501,0.4812816977500915,0.1405254751443863,0.0297704264521598,0.6719363927841187,0.4179213345050812,0.0511483736336231,0.4911791980266571,0.3108446598052978,0.3871871531009674,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"Between active seekers and non-users: segments of science-related media usage in Switzerland and Germany
Citizens’ attitudes toward science are related to their use of science-related information from various sources. Evidence is scarce regarding citizens’ individual media repertoires for staying informed about science as segmentation studies so far have primarily focused on scientific attitudes. In this paper, we explore audience segments regarding their science-related information behavior and whether such segments are comparable or vary between two countries with similar information environments. Based on two surveys in Switzerland and Germany, we identify national audience segments that differ in their science-related information repertoires, and analyze their sociodemographic characteristics and science-related attitudes. In both countries, we find very comparable information user segments ranging from those who inform themselves frequently about science (“Active Seekers”/“Science Consumers”) to those who hardly get in contact with any information about science and research (“Non-Users”).

12,"The electoral consequences of offshoring: how the globalization of production shapes party preferences
How does offshoring affect individual party preferences in multiparty systems? We argue that exposure to offshoring influences individual preferences for those political parties with clear policy positions on issues relevant for individuals with offshorable jobs (left, liberal, and center-right parties) but does not affect voting decisions for parties concentrating on other issues (green or populist right parties). Examining individual-level data from five waves of the European Social Survey for 18 advanced democracies, we find that these effects vary by skill level and exposure. Offshoring increases preferences for liberal and center-right parties that advocate economic openness among the highly skilled. In contrast, low-skilled individuals exposed to offshoring are more likely to prefer leftist political parties that champion social protection and redistribution. Offshoring does not affect the propensity to vote for green and populist right parties.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:151155,0.0439413189888,0.0213759988546371,0.014636505395174,0.7026116847991943,0.016398224979639,0.0021939559374004,0.0022611808963119,0.9523599147796632,0.0429044552147388,0.9902018904685974,0.0333755128085613,0.0853742286562919,0.0618225894868373,0.002317156875506,0.009322740137577,0.9964193105697632,0.2217632830142974,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"The effect of consumer scepticism on the perceived value of a sustainable hotel booking
Tourists find it hard to evaluate the advantages of a sustainable hotel and others may be even sceptical about sustainable tourism altogether. The study reported here was designed to investigate the associations between perceived benefits, perceived costs, and perceived value while booking a sustainable hotel. In addition, the moderating role of scepticism is assessed relating the paths linking the study variables. The study is based on an online survey carried out with1056 respondents in the USA. The results of structural equation modeling indicate that the perceived benefits, both authentic and environmental benefits were significantly influencing perceived value; and perceived value had a significant influence on booking intentions. The moderating effect of scepticism on authentic benefit perceptions with perceived value suggests that when respondents are sceptical about sustainability in general, it alters the relationship between authentic benefit perceptions and perceived value showing a negative impact. The study provides implications for sustainable hotel marketing by emphasising the need to understand how potential consumers perceive the sustainable product value and how this affects their booking intentions.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:161636,0.0039054334629327,0.1047367975115776,0.020458947867155,0.0863367319107055,0.0023835997562855,0.0018806753214448,0.0019916980527341,0.98372483253479,0.6115366816520691,0.0352978035807609,0.1839432418346405,0.9531837701797484,0.0035431215073913,0.0078897289931774,0.9612120389938354,0.00304468232207,0.5763556957244873,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"The influence of trust perceptions on German tourists’ intention to book a sustainable hotel: a new approach to analysing marketing information
This study examined the relationship between German tourists’ trust perceptions and their intention to book a sustainable hotel, pioneering a new quantitative approach to sustainable tourism marketing. Data came from 300 respondents who participated in an online survey. Respondents were given a digital brochure to read containing information about a “fictitious” three-star beach hotel in Portugal, before completing a questionnaire that measured inter alia their intention to book this sustainable hotel. Both individual “general trust” (perception of others’ trustworthiness) and “specific trust” towards the fictitious hotel in the brochure were measured. The survey also evaluated respondents’ perceptions about the usefulness of the information in the brochure. Multiple regression analysis of the data indicated that general trust, trusting the hotel and perceived usefulness of the brochure were positively and significantly related to booking intentions. An interaction between general trust and perceived usefulness was also observed. This means that the higher the perception rate about the brochure's usefulness, the higher general trust was for booking intentions and vice versa. The practical implications of the results suggest that tourists could be motivated to book a hotel if its sustainability attributes and amenities were communicated in a trust inspiring way in marketing material.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:133478,0.0039131203666329,0.0239827875047922,0.0113732255995273,0.1276789754629135,0.0023261893074959,0.0036216734442859,0.0021995468996465,0.9782025218009948,0.6267906427383423,0.0247984882444143,0.2093389332294464,0.8804651498794556,0.0038035616744309,0.8203327655792236,0.931496560573578,0.012217410840094,0.8706417679786682,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.

We investigate whether growth in consumer income causes an increased willingness to pay to mitigate negative externalities from consumption. Correlational field evidence suggests a positive relationship between income and social responsibility. To investigate a causal link, we conduct a laboratory market experiment in which firms and consumers can exchange products that differ in the degree to which they mitigate negative external impacts at the expense of higher production costs. Our treatments exogenously vary consumers’ incomes. Our experimental results reveal that growth in consumer income causes an increase in the share of socially responsible consumption in the laboratory.

This paper studies the impact of a key feature of competitive markets on moral behavior: the possibility that a competitor will step in and conclude the deal if a conscientious market actor forgoes a profitable business opportunity for ethical reasons. We study experimentally whether people employ the argument ""if I don’t do it, someone else will"" to justify taking a narrowly self-interested action. Our data reveal a clear pattern. Subjects do not employ the ""replacement excuse"" if a social norm exists that classifies the selfish action as immoral. But if no social norm exists, subjects are more inclined to take a selfish action in situations where another subject can otherwise take it.

12,"Assessing Indirect Environmental Effects of Information and Communication Technology (ICT): A Systematic Literature Review
Indirect environmental effects of information and communication technology (ICT) are those effects of ICT that change patterns of production or consumption in domains other than ICT, or more precisely, the environmental consequences of these changes. Digitalization as the societal process of ICT-driven change has created increasing interest in the indirect environmental effects of this technology. Assessments of indirect effects face various methodological challenges, such as the definition of the system boundary, the definition of a baseline as a reference or the occurrence of rebound effects. Existing studies use various approaches or methods to assess a spectrum of ICT use cases in several application domains. In view of the large number of assessments that have been conducted, the choices made when applying assessment methods, and the variety of ICT use cases in different application domains investigated, we present a systematic literature review of existing assessments of indirect environmental effects of ICT. The review provides a state-of-the-art overview of the methods used in the research field and is intended to support researchers in designing sound assessments which yield significant results. We identified 54 studies in seven main application domains using 15 different assessment approaches. The most common application domains are virtual mobility (e.g., telecommuting), virtual goods (e.g., digital media), and smart transport (e.g., route optimization). Life-cycle assessment, partial footprint, and the “ICT enablement method” are the most common approaches. The major part of the assessments focuses on patterns of production (e.g., production of paper-based books vs. e-books), a smaller part on patterns of consumption (e.g., changes in media consumption). Based on these results, we identify as a research gap the investigation of ICT impacts on consumer behavior, which could, for example, focus on social practices, and account for the dynamic implications of change. Elaborating such an approach could provide valuable insights into ICT’s impact on society and the resulting environmental consequences.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:153142,0.0040760082192718,0.0086650094017386,0.0111214779317379,0.0609398558735847,0.0023878044448792,0.0060316151939332,0.0020224738400429,0.0122954118996858,0.8182507753372192,0.7912570834159851,0.7447575926780701,0.97419410943985,0.0045952224172651,0.0171917360275983,0.3631257116794586,0.0783944875001907,0.019346460700035,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.

The increased use of digital information and communications technologies (ICT) is giving rise to fast-growing waste streams that contain important material resources. In contrast to bulk materials and precious metals, the recovery of most critical metals has not yet been commercially established, and they are thus lost within the recycling process. In this article, we used dynamic material flow analysis to explore the stocks and flows of indium, neodymium, and gold incorporated in end-user devices in Switzerland. Our analysis covered the use, collection, recycling, and disposal phases. This enabled us to track the three metals from their entry into Switzerland as components of new devices until their recovery, disposal in landfills, or dissipation to the environment. Using statistical entropy analysis (SEA), we further analyzed the dilution or concentration of the metals during their route through the current system. The data uncertainty was addressed employing a probabilistic approach. The largest quantities of all three metals are found in the devices currently in use. The second-largest stocks are slags disposed in landfills for indium, slags used for construction for neodymium, and the output of metal recovery processes for gold. The SEA illustrates how the current collection and recycling system successfully concentrates all three metals. While 70% of gold leaving the use phase is recovered, indium and neodymium are dissipated to slags after smelting and incineration processes due to the lack of economic incentives and lacking recovery processes on a commercial scale.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:153143,0.0044594011269509,0.011772527359426,0.018410051241517,0.0017115052323788,0.0021699168719351,0.0183835700154304,0.0033867203164845,0.1845625191926956,0.8562429547309875,0.0123964808881282,0.2003784775733947,0.8322324156761169,0.0044468403793871,0.9890913963317872,0.017757361754775,0.0031082383356988,0.0104541340842843,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"Limits and sustainable interaction design: Obsolescence in a future of collapse and resource scarcity
Electronic waste, caused by the advancements of technology and its rapidly increasing obsolescence, represents a major threat to environmental sustainability. Research in sustainable HCI has proposed a variety of solutions to tackle this issue, but has yet to create a major impact in product design. While currently industry’s goals are opposed to research’s concepts of addressing obsolescence, a future of collapse and resource scarcity requires a revisit of those contributions: changes in society at large, such as a decrease of resource availability, different needs, requirements, and desires of the consumer, but also new directions of industry and marketing might enable researchers to bring their old concepts into practice.

Demand for high-skilled workers who perform cognitive tasks has increased dramatically in the United States over the past four decades, with the biggest change between 1980 and 2000.

12,"Dodging the taxman: firm misreporting and limits to tax enforcement
Reducing tax evasion is a priority for many governments. A growing literature argues that verifying taxpayer reports against third-party information is critical for tax collection. However, effectiveness can be limited when tax authorities face constraints to credible enforcement and taxpayers make offsetting adjustments on other margins. We exploit a policy intervention in which Ecuadorian firms were notified about detected revenue discrepancies. Most firms simply failed to respond. Firms that responded increased reported revenue, matching the discrepancy amount when provided. However, they also increased reported costs by 96 cents per dollar of revenue adjustment, resulting in minor increases in tax collection.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:136557,0.1209441348910331,0.0115364110097289,0.0184697806835174,0.0198258403688669,0.0062042609788477,0.0026163219008594,0.0043310369364917,0.1062090471386909,0.7706489562988281,0.990254819393158,0.023172652348876,0.008171553723514,0.6780205965042114,0.0029029715806245,0.0059608370065689,0.916752278804779,0.9007524847984314,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"Corporate governance in a risk society
Under conditions of growing interconnectedness of the global economy, more and more stakeholders are exposed to risks and costs resulting from business activities that are neither regulated nor compensated for by means of national governance. The changing distribution of risks poses a threat to the legitimacy of business firms that normally derive their legitimacy from operating in compliance with the legal rules of democratic nation states. However, during the process of globalization, the regulatory power of nation states has been weakened and many production processes have been shifted to states with weak regulatory frameworks where businesses operate outside the reach of the democratic nation state. As a result, business firms have to address the various legitimacy challenges of their operations directly and cannot rely upon the legitimacy of their regulatory environment. These developments challenge the dominant approach to corporate governance that regards shareholders as the only stakeholder group in need of special protection due to risks not covered by contracts and legal regulations. On the basis of these considerations, we argue for a democratization of corporate governance structures in order to compensate for the governance deficits in their regulatory environment and to cope with the changing allocation of risks and costs. By way of democratic involvement of various stakeholders, business firms may be able to mitigate the redistribution of individual risk and address the resulting legitimacy deficits even when operating under conditions of regulatory gaps and governance failure.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:85053,0.0040860860608518,0.0866480693221092,0.0288913156837224,0.0024708337150514,0.003096800064668,0.0022203668486326,0.0022680719848722,0.0311041083186864,0.8032844662666321,0.2944590747356415,0.0513183027505874,0.29083052277565,0.0117654670029878,0.0053593469783663,0.7476220726966858,0.9955939650535583,0.9566230177879332,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.
12,"Legitimacy-as-Feeling: How affect leads to vertical legitimacy spillovers in transnational governance
Transnational governance schemes (TGSs) are interorganizational networks of public and/or private actors that jointly regulate global public policy issues, such as the prevention of human rights violations and the protection of ecosystems. Considering that TGSs mainly address issues of public concern, the general public represents a major source of legitimacy in transnational governance. We theorize how members of the general public, whom we conceptualize as intuiters, apply heuristics to bestow legitimacy on TGSs. Given the difficulty of assessing TGSs, we argue that intuiters draw on affect-based responses towards a TGS's better-known network affiliates, such as participating business firms, to judge the legitimacy of the TGS as a whole. This substitution produces a “vertical” legitimacy spillover. More specifically, we examine the heuristic process of judgment underlying vertical spillovers in TGSs and derive implications for the legitimacy construct and the analysis of spillover phenomena.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:87341,0.0039927009493112,0.0114993965253233,0.0056085577234625,0.0045363185927271,0.0094996476545929,0.0063147358596324,0.0019784462638199,0.0260994508862495,0.7194187045097351,0.2294145226478576,0.01778569445014,0.2040019631385803,0.003725117072463,0.2461934387683868,0.927271604537964,0.9946012496948242,0.9281664490699768,Responsible Consumption and Production,Aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.

Greenhouse gases such as CO2 strongly contribute to the rising temperatures of our planet, but as long as our society is dependent on fossil fuels, this trend will even increase in the near future. Therefore, CO2 capture and subsequent utilization constitute an approach for decarbonization and CO2 mitigation, and for this purpose, amine scrubbing remains the industrially most established process. In this article, we describe the CO2 capture-ability of pyrrolizidine-based diamines, a scaffold with remarkably good properties to fulfill this challenge. We observed fast equimolar CO2-uptake, as well as high stability of these compounds during multiple capture and release-cycles. In addition, the amines could be utilized for direct air capture. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the pyrrolizidine absorbents in the reduction of CO2 and for the formation of oxazolidinones.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167589,0.0039161294698715,0.012456813827157,0.025856863707304,0.0019196009961888,0.0020793650764971,0.9602675437927246,0.9521578550338744,0.0074891857802867,0.972806990146637,0.0034594843164086,0.1311860680580139,0.9693808555603028,0.4350267052650451,0.7012789845466614,0.1634326577186584,0.0031473643612116,0.0091691203415393,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Alteration of nitrous oxide emissions from floodplain soils by aggregate size, litter accumulation and plant–soil interactions
Semi-terrestrial soils such as floodplain soils are considered potential hot spots of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Microhabitats in the soil – such as within and outside of aggregates, in the detritusphere, and/or in the rhizosphere – are considered to promote and preserve specific redox conditions. Yet our understanding of the relative effects of such microhabitats and their interactions on N2O production and consumption in soils is still incomplete. Therefore, we assessed the effect of aggregate size, buried leaf litter, and plant–soil interactions on the occurrence of enhanced N2O emissions under simulated flooding/drying conditions in a mesocosm experiment. We used two model soils with equivalent structure and texture, comprising macroaggregates (4000–250 µm) or microaggregates (<250 µm) from a N-rich floodplain soil. These model soils were planted with basket willow (Salix viminalis L.), mixed with leaf litter or left unamended. After 48 h of flooding, a period of enhanced N2O emissions occurred in all treatments. The unamended model soils with macroaggregates emitted significantly more N2O during this period than those with microaggregates. Litter addition modulated the temporal pattern of the N2O emission, leading to short-term peaks of high N2O fluxes at the beginning of the period of enhanced N2O emission. The presence of S. viminalis strongly suppressed the N2O emission from the macroaggregate model soil, masking any aggregate-size effect. Integration of the flux data with data on soil bulk density, moisture, redox potential and soil solution composition suggest that macroaggregates provided more favourable conditions for spatially coupled nitrification–denitrification, which are particularly conducive to net N2O production. The local increase in organic carbon in the detritusphere appears to first stimulate N2O emissions; but ultimately, respiration of the surplus organic matter shifts the system towards redox conditions where N2O reduction to N2 dominates. Similarly, the low emission rates in the planted soils can be best explained by root exudation of low-molecular-weight organic substances supporting complete denitrification in the anoxic zones, but also by the inhibition of denitrification in the zone, where rhizosphere aeration takes place. Together, our experiments highlight the importance of microhabitat formation in regulating oxygen (O2) content and the completeness of denitrification in soils during drying after saturation. Moreover, they will help to better predict the conditions under which hot spots, and “hot moments”, of enhanced N2O emissions are most likely to occur in hydrologically dynamic soil systems like floodplain soils.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168741,0.0041480041109025,0.7911196351051331,0.0237945560365915,0.0020516319200396,0.0021038844715803,0.6920162439346313,0.003117220243439,0.0047636181116104,0.0088387830182909,0.0037545822560787,0.3042652308940887,0.4721335470676422,0.0211813431233167,0.0722557827830314,0.9170737862586976,0.003150416072458,0.009240330196917,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Reconstruction of historic forest cover changes indicates minor effects on carbon stocks in swiss forest soils
Forest cover in Switzerland and other European countries has gradually increased in the past century. Our knowledge of the impacts of forest expansion and development on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is, however, limited due to uncertainties in land-use history and lack of historical soil samples. We investigated the effect of forest age on current SOC storage in Switzerland. For 857 sites, we analysed SOC stocks and determined the minimal forest age for all presently forested sites using digitized historical maps, classifying all sites into three categories: young (≤60 years), medium (60–120 years), and old (≥120 years) forests. Grassland was the primary previous use of afforested land. Forest age affected current SOC stocks only moderately, whereas climate, soil chemistry, and tree species exerted a stronger impact. In the organic layer, highest SOC stocks were found in medium sites ($3.0 \pm 0.3 kg C m^{−2}$). As compared to other age categories, these sites had a 10% higher cover in coniferous forests with higher organic layer C stocks than broadleaf forests. SOC stocks in mineral soils decreased with increasing forest age ($12.5 \pm 0.9, 11.4 \pm 0.5, 10.5 \pm 0.3 kg C m^{−2}$). This decrease was primarily related to a 200-m higher average elevation of young sites and higher SOC stocks in a colder and more humid climate. In summary, forest age has only a minor effect on SOC storage in Swiss forest soils. Therefore, ongoing forest expansion in mountainous regions of Europe is unlikely contributing to soil C sequestration.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:149847,0.0044673383235931,0.0625433474779129,0.0176631696522235,0.0020834624301642,0.0020771736744791,0.0091919209808111,0.0022931341081857,0.0062220767140388,0.1538714319467544,0.0037153139710426,0.6750659346580505,0.8558668494224548,0.9101421236991882,0.0583367347717285,0.9913699626922609,0.0029628425836563,0.0101528959348797,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Plant species diversity affects soil–atmosphere fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide
Plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning can potentially interact with global climate by altering fluxes of the radiatively active trace gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). We studied the effects of grassland species richness (1-16) in combination with application of fertilizer (nitrogen:phosphorus:potassium = 100:43.6:83 kg ha(-1) a(-1)) on N2O and CH4 fluxes in a long-term field experiment. Soil N2O emissions, measured over 2 years using static chambers, decreased with species richness unless fertilizer was added. N2O emissions increased with fertilization and the fraction of legumes in plant communities. Soil CH4 uptake, a process driven by methanotrophic bacteria, decreased with plant species numbers, irrespective of fertilization. Using structural equation models, we related trace gas fluxes to soil moisture, soil inorganic N concentrations, nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activity, and the abundance of ammonia oxidizers, nitrite oxidizers, and denitrifiers (quantified by real-time PCR of gene fragments amplified from microbial DNA in soil). These analyses indicated that plant species richness increased soil moisture, which in turn increased N cycling-related activities. Enhanced N cycling increased N2O emission and soil CH4 uptake, with the latter possibly caused by removal of inhibitory ammonium by nitrification. The moisture-related indirect effects were surpassed by direct, moisture-independent effects opposite in direction. Microbial gene abundances responded positively to fertilizer but not to plant species richness. The response patterns we found were statistically robust and highlight the potential of plant biodiversity to interact with climatic change through mechanisms unrelated to carbon storage and associated carbon dioxide removal.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:131343,0.0041158352978527,0.9312472343444824,0.0309202149510383,0.0020133750513195,0.002151449676603,0.9475831985473632,0.0018936267588287,0.0050008771941065,0.0090187788009643,0.0034032461699098,0.022352784872055,0.8143805861473083,0.896452784538269,0.0678266361355781,0.8163999319076538,0.0030217063613235,0.0092366775497794,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Tree diversity enhances stand carbon storage but not leaf area in a subtropical forest
Research about biodiversity–productivity relationships has focused on herbaceous ecosystems, with results from tree field studies only recently beginning to emerge. Also, the latter are concentrated largely in the temperate zone. Tree species diversity generally is much higher in subtropical and tropical than in temperate or boreal forests, with reasons not fully understood. Niche overlap and thus complementarity in the use of resources that support productivity may be lower in forests than in herbaceous ecosystems, suggesting weaker productivity responses to diversity change in forests. We studied stand basal area, vertical structure, leaf area, and their relationship with tree species richness in a subtropical forest in south-east China. Permanent forest plots of 30 x 30 m were selected to span largely independent gradients in tree species richness and secondary successional age. Plots with higher tree species richness had a higher stand basal area. Also, stand basal area increases over a 4-year census interval were larger at high than at low diversity. These effects translated into increased carbon stocks in aboveground phytomass (estimated using allometric equations). A higher variability in tree height in more diverse plots suggested that these effects were facilitated by denser canopy packing due to architectural complementarity between species. In contrast, leaf area was not or even negatively affected by tree diversity, indicating a decoupling of carbon accumulation from leaf area. Alternatively, the same community leaf area might have assimilated more C per time interval in more than in less diverse plots because of differences in leaf turnover and productivity or because of differences in the display of leaves in vertical and horizontal space. Overall, our study suggests that in species-rich forests niche-based processes support a positive diversity–productivity relationship and that this translates into increased carbon storage in long-lived woody structures. Given the high growth rates of these forests during secondary succession, our results further indicate that a forest management promoting tree diversity after disturbance may accelerate CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere and thus be relevant in a climate-change context.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:131341,0.0040852129459381,0.4864479303359985,0.0250989459455013,0.0021651438437402,0.0020169750787317,0.0243911109864711,0.0022447414230555,0.9259725213050842,0.0089996857568621,0.003581806551665,0.4213694930076599,0.8674291372299194,0.9293416738510132,0.1259576976299286,0.9913103580474854,0.0030482972506433,0.0091044437140226,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Effects of long-term CO2 enrichment on soil-atmosphere CH4 fluxes and the spatial micro-distribution of methanotrophic bacteria
Background: Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant growth and associated C cycling have intensively been studied, but less is known about effects on the fluxes of radiatively active trace gases other than CO2. Net soil-atmosphere CH4 fluxes are determined by the balance of soil microbially-driven methane (CH4) oxidation and methanogenesis, and both might change under elevated CO2.
Methods and Results: Here, we studied CH4 dynamics in a permanent grassland exposed to elevated CO2 for 14 years. Soil-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 were measured using large static chambers, over a period of four years. The ecosystem was a net sink for atmospheric CH4 for most of the time except summer to fall when net CH4 emissions occurred. We did not detect any elevated CO2 effects on CH4 fluxes, but emissions were difficult to quantify due to their discontinuous nature, most likely because of ebullition from the saturated zone. Potential methanotrophic activity, determined by incubation of fresh sieved soil under standardized conditions, also did not reveal any effect of the CO2 treatment. Finally, we determined the spatial micro-distribution of methanotrophic activity at less than 5× atmospheric (10 ppm) and elevated (10000 ppm) CH4 concentrations, using a novel auto-radiographic technique. These analyses indicated that domains of net CH4 assimilation were distributed throughout the analyzed top 15 cm of soils, with no dependence on CH4 concentration or CO2 treatment.
Conclusions: Our investigations suggest that elevated CO2 exerts no or only minor effects on CH4 fluxes in the type of ecosystem we studied, at least as long as soil moisture differences are small or absent as was the case here. The autoradiographic analyses further indicate that the spatial niche of CH4 oxidation does not shift in response to CO2 enrichment or CH4 concentration, and that the same type of methanotrophs may oxidize CH4 from atmospheric and soil-internal sources.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:111494,0.0040942709892988,0.6943081021308899,0.0294127706438303,0.0019390592351555,0.0020912028849124,0.8697164058685303,0.0018821500707417,0.005042222328484,0.0090201254934072,0.0034443049225956,0.0506972521543502,0.7102592587471008,0.0045599499717354,0.1495554000139236,0.8355789184570312,0.0031603225506842,0.0091210370883345,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"The interacting effects of forestry and climate change on the demography of a group-living bird population
Anthropogenic degradation of natural habitats is a global driver of wildlife population declines. Local population responses to such environmental perturbations are generally well understood, but in socially structured populations, interactions between environmental and social factors may influence population responses. Thus, understanding how habitat degradation affects the dynamics of these populations requires simultaneous consideration of social and environmental mechanisms underlying demographic responses. Here we investigated the effect of habitat degradation through commercial forestry on spatiotemporal dynamics of a group-living bird, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus, in boreal forests of northern Sweden. We assessed the interacting effects of forestry, climate and population density on stage-specific, seasonal life-history rates and population dynamics, using long-term, individual-based demographic data from 70 territories in natural and managed forests. Stage-specific survival and reproductive rates, and consequently population growth, were lower in managed forests than in natural forests. Population growth was most sensitive to breeder survival and was more sensitive to early dispersing juveniles than those delaying dispersal. Forestry decreased population growth in managed forests by reducing reproductive success and breeder survival. Increased snow depth improved winter survival, and warmer spring temperatures enhanced reproductive success, particularly in natural forests. Population growth was stable in natural forests but it was declining in managed forests, and this difference accelerated under forecasted climate scenarios. Thus, climatic change could exacerbate the rate of forestry-induced population decline through reduced snow cover in our study species, and in other species with similar life-history characteristics and habitat requirements.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168432,0.0039713811129331,0.114540509879589,0.0078413635492324,0.0018860346172004,0.5210095047950745,0.0406844727694988,0.0022191817406564,0.0070825833827257,0.0091348644345998,0.1300145983695984,0.1950397938489914,0.8362295031547546,0.943805694580078,0.1062829419970512,0.9895143508911132,0.0029872278682887,0.0140505088493227,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Effects of directional environmental change on extinction dynamics in experimental microbial communities are predicted by a simple model
Global temperatures are expected to rise between 1.1 and 6.4°C over the next 100 years, although the exact rate will depend on future greenhouse emissions, and will vary spatially. Temperature can alter an individual's metabolic rate, and consequently birth and death rates. In declining populations, these alterations may manifest as changes in the rate of that population's decline, and subsequently the timing of extinction events. Predicting such events could therefore be of considerable use. We use a small-scale experimental system to investigate how the rate of temperature change can alter a population's time to extinction, and whether it is possible to predict this event using a simple phenomenological model that incorporates information about population dynamics at a constant temperature, published scaling of metabolic rates, and temperature. In addition, we examine 1) the relative importance of the direct effects of temperature on metabolic rate, and the indirect effects (via temperature driven changes in body size), on predictive accuracy (defined as the proximity of the predicted date of extinction to the mean observed date of extinction), 2) the combinations of model parameters that maximise accuracy of predictions, and 3) whether substituting temperature change through time with mean temperature produces accurate predictions. We find that extinction occurs earlier in environments that warm faster, and this can be accurately predicted (R2 > 0.84). Increasing the number of parameters that were temperature-dependent increased the model's accuracy, as did scaling these temperature-dependent parameters with either the direct effects of temperature alone, or with the direct and indirect effects. Using mean temperature through time instead of actual temperature produces less accurate predictions of extinction. These results suggest that simple phenomenological models, incorporating metabolic theory, may be useful in understanding how environmental change can alter a population's rate of extinction.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:87012,0.0039278217591345,0.1539278179407119,0.895477831363678,0.0016334545798599,0.0021749185398221,0.0343506298959255,0.3294916749000549,0.0077257789671421,0.0091942539438605,0.0708188563585281,0.0658679902553558,0.7117177248001099,0.4721156656742096,0.433904230594635,0.7022567987442017,0.0029369676485657,0.0089575611054897,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Accelerating rates of Arctic carbon cycling revealed by long-term atmospheric CO 2 measurements
The contemporary Arctic carbon balance is uncertain, and the potential for a permafrost carbon feedback of anywhere from 50 to 200 petagrams of carbon (Schuur et al., 2015) compromises accurate 21st-century global climate system projections. The 42-year record of atmospheric CO2 measurements at Barrow, Alaska (71.29 N, 156.79 W), reveals significant trends in regional land-surface CO2 anomalies (ΔCO2), indicating long-term changes in seasonal carbon uptake and respiration. Using a carbon balance model constrained by ΔCO2, we find a 13.4% decrease in mean carbon residence time (50% confidence range = 9.2 to 17.6%) in North Slope tundra ecosystems during the past four decades, suggesting a transition toward a boreal carbon cycling regime. Temperature dependencies of respiration and carbon uptake suggest that increases in cold season Arctic labile carbon release will likely continue to exceed increases in net growing season carbon uptake under continued warming trends.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167341,0.004074243362993,0.1007741093635559,0.0044518378563225,0.0020386055111885,0.002124557737261,0.1888187825679779,0.0027784374542534,0.0055383569560945,0.0099240653216838,0.0036678151227533,0.0560928098857402,0.6204167008399963,0.9857941269874572,0.9674698710441588,0.4158166348934173,0.0031953644938766,0.0090106250718235,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Giant tortoise habitats under increasing drought conditions on Aldabra Atoll—Ecological indicators to monitor rainfall anomalies and related vegetation activity
Aldabra Atoll has the largest population of giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) in the world. As such an important biological resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we calculated the standardized, precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969–2013. We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought months per year today compared with about two months per year in the 1970s (t =2.884, p=0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between 2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra’s vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the habitat composition across the atoll.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:138693,0.0039917342364788,0.0565431639552116,0.0083795897662639,0.001994845457375,0.0021811020560562,0.9403111338615416,0.001931888400577,0.3811794817447662,0.0095718000084161,0.0036448957398533,0.0773503184318542,0.5182070136070251,0.9205648899078368,0.964061439037323,0.1052759364247322,0.0031166956759989,0.008959331549704,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Contrasting radiation and soil heat fluxes in Arctic shrub and wet sedge tundra
Vegetation changes, such as shrub encroachment and wetland expansion, have been observed in many Arctic tundra regions. These changes feed back to permafrost and climate. Permafrost can be protected by soil shading through vegetation as it reduces the amount of solar energy available for thawing. Regional climate can be affected by a reduction in surface albedo as more energy is available for atmospheric and soil heating. Here, we compared the shortwave radiation budget of two common Arctic tundra vegetation types dominated by dwarf shrubs (Betula nana) and wet sedges (Eriophorum angustifolium) in North-East Siberia. We measured time series of the shortwave and longwave radiation budget above the canopy and transmitted radiation below the canopy. Additionally, we quantified soil temperature and heat flux as well as active layer thickness. The mean growing season albedo of dwarf shrubs was 0.15 ± 0.01, for sedges it was higher (0.17 ± 0.02). Dwarf shrub transmittance was 0.36 ± 0.07 on average, and sedge transmittance was 0.28 ± 0.08. The standing dead leaves contributed strongly to the soil shading of wet sedges. Despite a lower albedo and less soil shading, the soil below dwarf shrubs conducted less heat resulting in a 17 cm shallower active layer as compared to sedges. This result was supported by additional, spatially distributed measurements of both vegetation types. Clouds were a major influencing factor for albedo and transmittance, particularly in sedge vegetation. Cloud cover reduced the albedo by 0.01 in dwarf shrubs and by 0.03 in sedges, while transmittance was increased by 0.08 and 0.10 in dwarf shrubs and sedges, respectively. Our results suggest that the observed deeper active layer below wet sedges is not primarily a result of the summer canopy radiation budget. Soil properties, such as soil albedo, moisture, and thermal conductivity, may be more influential, at least in our comparison between dwarf shrub vegetation on relatively dry patches and sedge vegetation with higher soil moisture.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:130718,0.0040441383607685,0.1273166090250015,0.0143889961764216,0.0018050143262371,0.0021118924487382,0.2446326464414596,0.5048605799674988,0.0063009546138346,0.0092427358031272,0.0035906669218093,0.1502998322248459,0.067140445113182,0.8672065734863281,0.9244333505630492,0.8695833683013916,0.0031615307088941,0.7163402438163757,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Arctic shrub effects on NDVI, summer albedo and soil shading
The influence of Arctic vegetation on albedo, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and active layer thickness is a crucial link between boundary layer climate and permafrost in the context of climate change. Shrubs have been observed to lower the albedo as compared to lichen or graminoid-tundra. Despite its importance, the quantification of the effect of shrubification on summer albedo has not been addressed in much detail. We manipulated shrub density and height in an Arctic dwarf birch (Betula nana) shrub canopy to test the effect on shortwave radiative fluxes and on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a proxy for vegetation productivity used in satellite-based studies. Additionally, we parametrised and validated the 3D radiative transfer model DART to simulate the amount of solar radiation reflected and transmitted by an Arctic shrub canopy. We compared results of model runs of different complexities to measured data from North-East Siberia. We achieved comparably good results with simple turbid medium approaches, including both leaf and branch optical property media, and detailed object based model parameterisations. It was important to explicitly parameterise branches as they accounted for up to 71% of the total canopy absorption and thus contributed significantly to soil shading. Increasing leaf biomass resulted in a significant increase of the NDVI, decrease of transmitted photosynthetically active radiation, and repartitioning of the absorption of shortwave radiation by the canopy components. However, experimental and modelling results show that canopy broadband nadir reflectance and albedo are not significantly decreasing with increasing shrub biomass. We conclude that the leaf to branch ratio, canopy background, and vegetation type replaced by shrubs need to be considered when predicting feedbacks of shrubification to summer albedo, permafrost thaw, and climate warming.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:104474,0.0040354933589696,0.2566781342029571,0.0115099502727389,0.0019423788180574,0.0020950234029442,0.1855804622173309,0.6384784579277039,0.8472524881362915,0.009550274349749,0.0034046552609652,0.1369701921939849,0.3787506222724914,0.927127718925476,0.9744395613670348,0.879176139831543,0.003070977050811,0.0103333452716469,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Historical glacier outlines from digitized topographic maps of the Swiss Alps
Since the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850, the total glacier area of the central European Alps has considerably decreased. In order to understand the changes in glacier coverage at various scales and to model past and future streamflow accurately, long-term and large-scale datasets of glacier outlines are needed. To fill the gap between the morphologically reconstructed glacier outlines from the moraine extent corresponding to the time period around 1850 and the first complete dataset of glacier areas in the Swiss Alps from aerial photographs in 1973, glacier areas from 80 sheets of a historical topographic map (the Siegfried map) were manually digitized for the publication years 1878–1918 (further called first period, with most sheets being published around 1900) and 1917–1944 (further called second period, with most sheets being published around 1935). The accuracy of the digitized glacier areas was then assessed through a two-step validation process: the data were (1) visually and (2) quantitatively compared to glacier area datasets of the years 1850, 1973, 2003, and 2010, which were derived from different sources, at the large scale, basin scale, and locally. The validation showed that at least 70 % of the digitized glaciers were comparable to the outlines from the other datasets and were therefore plausible. Furthermore, the inaccuracy of the manual digitization was found to be less than 5 %. The presented datasets of glacier outlines for the first and second periods are a valuable source of information for long-term glacier mass balance or hydrological modelling in glacierized basins. The uncertainty of the historical topographic maps should be considered during the interpretation of the results.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:151147,0.0039272289723157,0.1034362316131591,0.0066777025349438,0.0016573201864957,0.0020735668949782,0.6235927939414978,0.0023976271040737,0.008433855138719,0.0092484885826706,0.0040743690915405,0.4741882979869842,0.0828792527318,0.3998511731624603,0.7918742895126343,0.5149162411689758,0.002911674324423,0.0092564653605222,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Controls on Last Glacial Maximum ice extent in the Weddell Sea embayment, Antarctica
The Weddell Sea sector of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is hypothesized to have made a significant contribution to sea-level rise since the Last Glacial Maximum. Using a numerical flowline model we investigate the controls on grounding line motion across the eastern Weddell Sea and compare our results with field data relating to past ice extent. Specifically, we investigate the influence of changes in ice temperature, accumulation, sea level, ice shelf basal melt, and ice shelf buttressing on the dynamics of the Foundation Ice Stream. We find that ice shelf basal melt plays an important role in controlling grounding line advance, while a reduction in ice shelf buttressing is found to be necessary for grounding line retreat. There are two stable positions for the grounding line under glacial conditions: at the northern margin of Berner Island and at the continental shelf break. Global mean sea-level contributions associated with these two scenarios are ~50mm and ~130 mm, respectively. Comparing model results with field evidence from the Pensacola Mountains and the Shackleton Range, we find it unlikely that ice was grounded at the continental shelf break for a prolonged period during the last glacial cycle. However, we cannot rule out a brief advance to this position or a scenario in which the grounding line retreated behind present during deglaciation and has since re-advanced. Better constraints on past ice sheet and ice shelf geometry, ocean temperature, and ocean circulation are needed to reconstruct more robustly past behavior of the Foundation Ice Stream.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:145477,0.003931569866836,0.0348942838609218,0.0054472410120069,0.0019552092999219,0.0021055410616099,0.0103332223370671,0.0019066029926761,0.0066408137790858,0.0098466156050562,0.0036659247707575,0.1046188622713089,0.640378475189209,0.0656151100993156,0.996891438961029,0.0177678279578685,0.0032455993350595,0.0095980456098914,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Threefold increase in marine-terminating outlet glacier retreat rates across the Atlantic Arctic: 1992–2010
Accelerated discharge through marine-terminating outlet glaciers has been a key component of the rapid mass loss from Arctic glaciers since the 1990s. However, glacier retreat and its climatic controls have not been assessed at the pan-Arctic scale. Consequently, the spatial and temporal variability in the magnitude of retreat, and the possible drivers are uncertain. Here we use remotely sensed data acquired over 273 outlet glaciers, located across the entire Atlantic Arctic (i.e. areas potentially influenced by North Atlantic climate and/or ocean conditions, specifically: Greenland, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and Svalbard), to demonstrate high-magnitude, accelerating and near-ubiquitous retreat between 1992 and 2010. Overall, mean retreat rates increased by a factor of 3.5 between 1992 and 2000 (−30.5 m a−1) and 2000–10 (−105.8 m a−1), with 97% of the study glaciers retreating during the latter period. The Retreat was greatest in northern, western and south-eastern Greenland and also increased substantially on the Barents Sea coast of Novaya Zemlya. Glacier retreat showed no significant or consistent relationship with summer air temperatures at decadal timescales. The rate of frontal position change showed a significant, but weak, correlation with changes in sea-ice concentrations. We highlight large variations in retreat rates within regions and suggest that fjord topography plays an important role. We conclude that marine-terminating Arctic outlet glaciers show a common response of rapid and accelerating retreat at decadal timescales.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:145470,0.0039344504475593,0.0463123358786106,0.0077382950112223,0.001923234318383,0.0020527460146695,0.0107614500448107,0.0020986462477594,0.0064838570542633,0.009414380416274,0.0038584023714065,0.1423925012350082,0.0121728358790278,0.9256037473678588,0.9968783855438232,0.0143851684406399,0.0031690441537648,0.0095587400719523,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Subglacial processes on an Antarctic ice stream bed. 2: Can modelled ice dynamics explain the morphology of mega-scale glacial lineations?
Mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) are highly elongate subglacial bedforms associated with ice streaming. However, the link between MSGLs and rapid ice flow is largely qualitative, and there have been few attempts to quantitatively link their formation to ice flow characteristics (e.g. ice velocity, thickness, basal shear stress). We take measurements of MSGLs from a palaeo-ice stream that once occupied Marguerite Trough, Antarctic Peninsula and explore a range of possible correlations with ice dynamics generated from an ensemble of numerical modelling experiments that reproduce the deglaciation of the ice stream. Our results confirm that high mean ice velocities and a weak bed correlate with longer MSGLs. Furthermore, the height of MSGLs are low (2–3 m) where modelled basal shear stress is low, but their height tends to be higher and more variable where basal shear stress is larger. The mean density of MSGLs decreases as ice flux increases. Our analysis further suggests that the length of MSGLs is a function of basal ice velocity and time. Although our data/model correlations confirm the importance of ice velocity in MSGL formation, a significant challenge remains if we are to employ MSGLs as a quantifiable measure of past ice stream velocity.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:130746,0.0038797724992036,0.0502179451286792,0.0112833911553025,0.0018517243443056,0.0030411453917622,0.2548387050628662,0.0163137074559927,0.0056682764552533,0.0095165912061929,0.0035187990870326,0.1597733348608017,0.0415651351213455,0.0041112196631729,0.996282398700714,0.0224110353738069,0.0032107792794704,0.0097908033058047,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Buying support at international negotiations: the strategic use of climate aid
The relationship between aid and voting in UN agencies has been well documented in the aid literature. We extend this analysis to the wider field of international negotiations, outside the sphere of formal voting, where decisions are mostly taken by consensus. Is aid used strategically to influence the negotiations in this context, too? Based on a novel dataset on negotiation behavior under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change we assess whether countries obtaining aid react by expressing increased support and/or reduced opposition towards the donor. Applying linear and instrumental variable regressions on a three-dimensional panel dataset with donor-recipient dyads for the period 2002-2013 enables us to distinguish between long-term partnerships and the strategic use of aid for the purpose of the negotiations. We find that aid can indeed buy support in the climate negotiations, but that this opportunity tends to be limited to mitigation and adaptation aid, rather than general aid. We argue that this is due to both greater demand for and greater supply of these specific types of aid, whose allocation is under the direct responsibility of the specialized delegates participating in the negotiations.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:141266,0.0038001521024852,0.0257501155138015,0.0100656393915414,0.0049333786591887,0.0032741024624556,0.0022129334975034,0.0033650512341409,0.0298313125967979,0.6101189851760864,0.1153567731380462,0.0916163623332977,0.0449308380484581,0.9945472478866576,0.0053245653398334,0.0066839298233389,0.7348567843437195,0.9887680411338806,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
13,"Motivated Rejection of Science
Some scientifically well-established results—such as the fact that emission of greenhouse gases produces global warming—are rejected by sizable proportions of the population in the United States and other countries. Rejection of scientific findings is mostly driven by motivated cognition: People tend to reject findings that threaten their core beliefs or worldview. At present, rejection of scientific findings by the U.S. public is more prevalent on the political right than the left.

13,"How ‘Digital-born’ media cover climate change in comparison to legacy media: A case study of the COP 21 summit in Paris
Climate change is often seen as a remote, complex or ‘unobtrusive’ topic by the general public – a topic about which many people acquire information mainly from media reporting. However, media landscapes are changing rapidly, particularly with the growth of the internet and social media. A number of new media organisations are challenging traditional media and have gained significant audiences for their environment content. We analyse the coverage by three of these – Huffington Post, Vice and BuzzFeed – of the COP21 summit in Paris at the end of 2015, and compare it with that of traditional media. We show that while the general spectrum of themes is similar across media outlets, there are differences in the volume of the coverage and in the emphasis that is laid on different themes by some, but not all, of the new players compared to traditional media.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:148179,0.0038409363478422,0.0083377929404377,0.0116490190848708,0.3097177743911743,0.0028318252880126,0.0020225592888891,0.0018653415609151,0.0246958173811435,0.0538722909986972,0.0846144556999206,0.2585049867630005,0.0650809183716774,0.9938803911209106,0.0054868566803634,0.5893824696540833,0.0904839858412742,0.0719983354210853,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

13,"A Financial Macro-Network Approach to Climate Policy Evaluation
Existing approaches to assess the economic impact of climate policies tend to overlook the financial sector and to focus only on direct effects of policies on the specific institutional sector they target, neglecting possible feedbacks between sectors, thus, underestimating the overall policy effect. To fill in this gap, we develop a methodology based on financial networks, which allows for analyzing the transmission throughout the economy of positive or negative shocks induced by the introduction of specific climate policies. We apply the methodology to empirical data of the Euro Area to identify the feedback loops between the financial sector and the real economy both through direct and indirect chains of financial exposures across multiple financial instruments. By focusing on climate policy-induced shocks that affect directly either the banking sector or non-financial firms, we analyze the reinforcing feedback loops that could amplify the effects of shocks on the financial sector and then cascade on the real economy. Our analysis helps to understand the conditions for virtuous or vicious cycles to arise in the climate-finance nexus and to provide a comprehensive assessment of the economic impact of climate policies.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168758,0.0038234335370361,0.0800652429461479,0.0046076797880232,0.001772484392859,0.0023941544350236,0.0017771188868209,0.0019266118761152,0.6321920156478882,0.663823664188385,0.1402888894081115,0.0361419096589088,0.080679178237915,0.9944226145744324,0.0041734753176569,0.0059241596609354,0.3446148037910461,0.6905874013900757,Climate Action,Aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

The role of development finance institutions in low‐income and emerging countries is fundamental to provide long‐term capital for investments in climate mitigation and adaptation. Nevertheless, development finance institutions still lack sound and transparent metrics to assess their projects' exposure to climate risks and their impact on global climate action. To attempt to fill this gap, we develop a novel climate stress‐test methodology for portfolios of loans to energy infrastructure projects. We apply the methodology to the portfolios of overseas energy projects of two main Chinese policy banks. We estimate their exposure to economic and financial shocks that would result in government inability to introduce timely 2°C‐aligned climate policies and from investors' inability to adapt their business to the changing climate and policy environment. We find that the negative shocks are mostly concentrated on coal and oil projects and vary across regions from 4.2 to 22 percent of the total loan value.

14,"Application of Environmental DNA Metabarcoding for Predicting Anthropogenic Pollution in Rivers
Rivers are among the most threatened freshwater ecosystems, and anthropogenic activities are affecting both river structures and water quality. While assessing the organisms can provide a comprehensive measure of a river’s ecological status, it is limited by the traditional morphotaxonomy-based biomonitoring. Recent advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding allow to identify prokaryotes and eukaryotes in one sequencing run, and could thus allow unprecedented resolution. Whether such eDNA-based data can be used directly to predict the pollution status of rivers as a complementation of environmental data remains unknown. Here we used eDNA metabarcoding to explore the main stressors of rivers along which community structure changes, and to identify the method’s potential for predicting pollution status based on eDNA data. We showed that a broad range of taxa in bacterial, protistan, and metazoan communities could be profiled with eDNA. Nutrients were the main driving stressor affecting communities’ structure, alpha diversity, and the ecological network. We specifically observed that the relative abundance of indicative OTUs was significantly correlated with nutrient levels. These OTUs data could be used to predict the nutrient status up to 79% accuracy on testing data sets. Thus, our study gives a novel approach to predicting the pollution status of rivers by eDNA data.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:159261,0.0039004751015454,0.0294530540704727,0.0100695369765162,0.0018812528578564,0.0020822978112846,0.9712157249450684,0.0805726498365402,0.0052291392348706,0.008804140612483,0.0032757415901869,0.0875117778778076,0.0621451437473297,0.0041950144805014,0.6057826280593872,0.6765901446342468,0.0030945662874728,0.0096249757334589,Life Below Water,"Aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development."
14,"Metacommunities in river networks: The importance of network structure and connectivity on patterns and processes
1. Rivers are spatially organised into hierarchic dendritic networks. This unique physical structure and the associated directionality of physical flows set them apart from most other environments by regulating the dispersal of resident biota and therefore the distribution of biodiversity.
2. The aim of this special issue is to highlight the importance of the river network on structuring biodiversity, particularly through metacommunity dynamics and associated dispersal processes.
3. The issue covers a wide range of topics, including disease spread, nutrient uptake, trophic dynamics, effects of anthropogenic stressors and the joint roles of dispersal and environmental filtering. Contributions employ a broad range of approaches, including field and laboratory experiments, modelling, population genetics and conceptual synthesis.
4. Although these studies represent just a sample of the research that is being per- formed on biodiversity and metacommunity dynamics in river networks, several important findings have emerged; a common theme being that the structure of the network and spatial dynamics clearly influence the dynamics of populations and communities, and their functions. By taking a broad taxonomic focus (from diatoms and protists to fish), and spanning a large geographic gradient (from the tropics to the subarctic), this special issue provides a broad look at the dynamics that occur in river networks relating to their unique makeup.

14,"Species turnover and invasion of dominant freshwater invertebrates alter biodiversity–ecosystem-function relationship
Freshwater ecosystems rely on allochthonous resources. Integration of these subsidies depends on diversity of both terrestrial resources and aquatic shredder and decomposer communities, but the diversity effects on leaf litter breakdown and decomposition are less clear in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. We need a better understanding of this relationship because aquatic communities are rapidly changing with species invasions and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we experimentally disentangled the effects of leaf and shredder richness on leaf litter breakdown by macroinvertebrates in mesocosm experiments using three species of amphipods, a dominant guild of crustaceans in European freshwater ecosystems. Increased leaf richness led to lower-than-predicted leaf consumption by native shredders, with mixed evidence of resource-switching or prioritization of preferred food items within a leaf mix. Higher shredder species richness never promoted leaf consumption rates compared to predictions from relevant single-species experiments, and instead sometimes substantially decreased leaf consumption. We then conducted a meta-analysis of leaf litter consumption rates by seven widely distributed amphipod species (the three used in the experiments and four additional species). As expected based on our own experiments, nonnative amphipod species generally had lower biomass- adjusted leaf litter consumption rates, although their larger body size led to higher per-individual leaf consumption rates. Contamination of the water by metals, pesticides, and other chemicals additionally significantly decreased leaf litter consumption by multiple native and nonnative species compared to unpolluted systems. While the meta-analysis suggested that litter consumption, and thus breakdown, would decline if native shredders are replaced by nonnative heterospecifics, complete species replacement is not the only outcome following immigration in a meta-community context. Our experiments suggest that breakdown rates could remain reasonably high where native species coexist with nonnative arrivals. Experiments that neglect the ecological realism of species coexistence will necessarily mischaracterize effects on ecosystem functioning.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:153774,0.0039563938044011,0.6560075283050537,0.0119310868903994,0.0018905299948528,0.0020595411770045,0.813831090927124,0.5043019652366638,0.0484402999281883,0.0090513071045279,0.9132647514343262,0.0113449143245816,0.2972182333469391,0.0045194854028522,0.8348601460456848,0.6273658275604248,0.0029828955885022,0.0092876749113202,Life Below Water,"Aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development."
14,"The future of biotic indices in the ecogenomic era: Integrating (e)DNA metabarcoding in biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems
The bioassessment of aquatic ecosystems is currently based on various biotic indices that use the occurrence and/ or abundance of selected taxonomic groups to define ecological status. These conventional indices have some limitations, often related to difficulties in morphological identification of bioindicator taxa. Recent development of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding could potentially alleviate some of these limitations, by using DNA sequences instead of morphology to identify organisms and to characterize a given ecosystem. In this paper, we review the structure of conventional biotic indices, and we present the results of pilot metabarcoding studies using environmental DNA to infer biotic indices.

14,"Life-history responses to environmental change revealed by resurrected rotifers from a historically polluted lake
Life-history adaptations to environmental change can be studied retrospectively in organisms that produce dormant propagules using methods of resurrection ecology. Here, we investigated such responses in a planktonic freshwater rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus. We resurrected 14 clonal lineages from resting eggs extracted from three distinct sediment layers—representing periods of high, medium and low copper pollution—of a previously contaminated lake (Lake Orta, Italy). We exposed the resurrected clones to four copper concentrations over 14 days and recorded population densities at 48 h intervals. If the original populations in Lake Orta had adapted to the changing pollution levels, we expected to find demographic evidence of this adaptation in the resurrected lineages. However, we found high clonal variation in population-growth dynamics, which was more pronounced within than between pollution periods. Moreover, intrinsic population growth rates (r) increased chronologically. As such, the results did not reveal signs of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, we found that lineages from the period of medium copper pollution invested less into sexual reproduction than lineages from the other periods. By using this bio-demographic perspective, our analysis of resurrected rotifers provides insights into the life-history responses of an aquatic invertebrate in an ever-changing environment.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:129155,0.003897693241015,0.0191631596535444,0.0073517956770956,0.0017344655934721,0.8185204863548279,0.8113391995429993,0.0021580338943749,0.0054917219094932,0.0092477761209011,0.1929662078619003,0.0822761431336402,0.7608112096786499,0.0039778412319719,0.9449454545974731,0.4179077446460724,0.0030249918345361,0.0095166089013218,Life Below Water,"Aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development."
14,"Demographic cost and mechanisms of adaptation to environmental stress in resurrected Daphnia
A characteristic feature of the Daphnia (Crustacea: Cladocera) life cycle are the so-called ephippia, which are fertilised eggs that need to undergo diapause. When they are shed by the female, they sink to the lake bottom, where they may become embedded in the sediment and may remain viable for decades. Extracting and hatching ephippia in the laboratory and subjecting resurrected lineages to conditions representative of historic lake environments allows retrospective investigation of life-history responses to environmental change. Here we reanalyse data from such a resurrection experiment (Piscia et al., 2015: Bull. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 94:46–51). Contemporary and past lineages of Daphnia galeata Sars 1863 were obtained from Lake Orta (Italy), a deep, subalpine lake with a well-documented history of industrial copper pollution. Experimental Daphnia were subjected to three copper treatments representative of two levels of historic as well as to current (i.e., unpolluted) lake conditions, and life-table data were collected. With these data at hand, we first estimated vital rates (survival, maturation, and reproduction) and used these rates to project the asymptotic population growth rates (λ) for each population-by-treatment combination. Next, we performed a retrospective decomposition to estimate the contributions of the vital rates to observed differences in λ. Finally, we used elasticity analysis to explore the functional relationship between λ and each of the vital rates. We found that survival rates were only compromised at elevated copper levels. Moreover, past, resurrected Daphnia had a higher λ at low copper concentrations compared to unpolluted conditions, but a lower λ when exposed to high copper levels. Contemporary Daphnia, on the other hand, only reproduced successfully in unpolluted water. Under these conditions, however, they had a higher population growth rate than the past Daphnia, suggesting a cost of copper tolerance in the latter. This cost was mainly due to a lower probability of reproduction and reduced fecundity, whereas survival rates contributed only little to differences in λ. Finally, we found higher elasticity values of λ to survival than to reproductive rates. This suggests that any change in the environment that will affect survival rather than reproductive parameters will have a much larger impact on Lake Orta’s current Daphnia population.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:123721,0.0039418460801243,0.2665916085243225,0.0425520315766334,0.001655479776673,0.6435908079147339,0.981130301952362,0.0022712680511176,0.0066334600560367,0.7839974164962769,0.0352930724620819,0.1956735104322433,0.8543222546577454,0.0044483267702162,0.9732787609100342,0.2189743369817733,0.0031651572789996,0.0093492539599537,Life Below Water,"Aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development."
14,"Rotifers in Lake Orta: a potential ecological and evolutionary model system
Lake Orta experienced for a few decades a unique history of chronic pollution, with extreme changes in pH and copper concentration. Currently, the lake has recovered to its almost pristine oligotrophic conditions, but its sediments still preserve the record of all the changes that happened since the establishment of the first polluting factories in the 1920s, through to the liming activities in 1989-1990, and to the recovery phase that is still going on. Here we review the current knowledge for Lake Orta regarding rotifers, a diverse component of the zooplankton of the lake, through studies on living organisms and on their resting stages accumulated in the sediments. We also report a brief review of what is known in general on the effects of changes in pH and copper concentration on rotifers at the population, species and community level, providing expectations for such effects on the rotifers of Lake Orta. Then, we conclude our review with a perspective on the potential use of rotifers hatched from the resting stages in the sediment of Lake Orta with the description of experiments that can be performed in the future in the framework of resurrection ecology, in order to understand the mechanisms of past and future changes in the environment.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:123722,0.0039571793749928,0.0080080842599272,0.0030958477873355,0.0018682113150134,0.0020847686100751,0.8030582666397095,0.001905087265186,0.0048453290946781,0.383645236492157,0.0034350911155343,0.1126943528652191,0.0193266402930021,0.0043755155056715,0.9791703224182128,0.9159842133522034,0.0032332481350749,0.0087226862087845,Life Below Water,"Aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development."
14,"Warming reduces the effects of enrichment on stability and functioning across levels of organisation in an aquatic microbial ecosystem
Warming and nutrient enrichment are major environmental factors shaping ecological dynamics. However, cross‐scale investigation of their combined effects by linking theory and experiments is lacking. We collected data from aquatic microbial ecosystems investigating the interactive effects of warming (constant and rising temperatures) and enrichment across levels of organisation and contrasted them with community models based on metabolic theory. We found high agreement between our observations and theoretical predictions: we observed in many cases the predicted antagonistic effects of high temperature and high enrichment across levels of organisation. Temporal stability of total biomass decreased with warming but did not differ across enrichment levels. Constant and rising temperature treatments with identical mean temperature did not show qualitative differences. Overall, we conclude that model and empirical results are in broad agreement due to robustness of the effects of temperature and enrichment, that the mitigating effects of temperature on effects of enrichment may be common, and that models based on metabolic theory provide qualitatively robust predictions of the combined ecological effects of enrichment and temperature.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170547,0.0039881109260022,0.5956559777259827,0.0135547379031777,0.0018466095207259,0.0022025858052074,0.9409825205802916,0.6020959615707397,0.0068195802159607,0.0088361343368887,0.0049147736281156,0.0200005993247032,0.3510500490665436,0.5159761905670166,0.8674188256263733,0.4945459961891174,0.0085595641285181,0.0086104376241564,Life Below Water,"Aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development."
14,"Inferring the temperature dependence of population parameters: the effects of experimental design and inference algorithm
Understanding and quantifying the temperature dependence of population parameters, such as intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity, is critical for predicting the ecological responses to environmental change. Many studies provide empirical estimates of such temperature dependencies, but a thorough investigation of the methods used to infer them has not been performed yet. We created artificial population time series using a stochastic logistic model parameterized with the Arrhenius equation, so that activation energy drives the temperature dependence of population parameters. We simulated different experimental designs and used different inference methods, varying the likelihood functions and other aspects of the parameter estimation methods. Finally, we applied the best performing inference methods to real data for the species Paramecium caudatum. The relative error of the estimates of activation energy varied between 5% and 30%. The fraction of habitat sampled played the most important role in determining the relative error; sampling at least 1% of the habitat kept it below 50%. We found that methods that simultaneously use all time series data (direct methods) and methods that estimate population parameters separately for each temperature (indirect methods) are complementary. Indirect methods provide a clearer insight into the shape of the functional form describing the temperature dependence of population parameters; direct methods enable a more accurate estimation of the parameters of such functional forms. Using both methods, we found that growth rate and carrying capacity of Paramecium caudatum scale with temperature according to different activation energies. Our study shows how careful choice of experimental design and inference methods can increase the accuracy of the inferred relationships between temperature and population parameters. The comparison of estimation methods provided here can increase the accuracy of model predictions, with important implications in understanding and predicting the effects of temperature on the dynamics of populations.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:104443,0.0040467781946063,0.1615055948495865,0.0108146416023373,0.0015293377218768,0.0023002559319138,0.0268561244010925,0.948649764060974,0.0141344079747796,0.0099873607978224,0.1507218182086944,0.0817667469382286,0.4883489310741424,0.0038409950211644,0.3288266956806183,0.6822255849838257,0.0836139172315597,0.011307499371469,Life Below Water,"Aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development."
15,"Biodiversity increases and decreases ecosystem stability
Losses and gains in species diversity affect ecological stability1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and the sustainability of ecosystem functions and services8,9,10,11,12,13. Experiments and models have revealed positive, negative and no effects of diversity on individual components of stability, such as temporal variability, resistance and resilience2,3,6,11,12,14. How these stability components covary remains poorly understood15. Similarly, the effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability16, which is conceptually akin to ecosystem multifunctionality17,18, remain unknown. Here we studied communities of aquatic ciliates to understand how temporal variability, resistance and overall ecosystem stability responded to diversity (that is, species richness) in a large experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems sampled 19 times over 40 days, resulting in 12,939 samplings. Species richness increased temporal stability but decreased resistance to warming. Thus, two stability components covaried negatively along the diversity gradient. Previous biodiversity manipulation studies rarely reported such negative covariation despite general predictions of the negative effects of diversity on individual stability components3. Integrating our findings with the ecosystem multifunctionality concept revealed hump- and U-shaped effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability. That is, biodiversity can increase overall ecosystem stability when biodiversity is low, and decrease it when biodiversity is high, or the opposite with a U-shaped relationship. The effects of diversity on ecosystem multifunctionality would also be hump- or U-shaped if diversity had positive effects on some functions and negative effects on others. Linking the ecosystem multifunctionality concept and ecosystem stability can transform the perceived effects of diversity on ecological stability and may help to translate this science into policy-relevant information.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:164959,0.0040883938781917,0.0575872100889682,0.0156612396240234,0.0017326896777376,0.0021211011335253,0.2421544194221496,0.001950011937879,0.0063678473234176,0.0091554969549179,0.0079516218975186,0.0161116626113653,0.6718300580978394,0.0626949071884155,0.7354402542114258,0.985263466835022,0.0028636869974434,0.0275086294859647,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."

Ecosystems are widely interconnected by spatial flows of material, but the overall importance of these flows relative to local ecosystem functioning remains unclear.

Magnitudes are similar to local fluxes in freshwater and benthic ecosystems, but two to three orders of magnitude lower in terrestrial systems, demonstrating different dependencies on spatial flows among ecosystem types.

Although the monitoring and prediction of ecosystem dynamics under global change have been extensively assessed, large gaps remain in our knowledge, including a need for concepts in rapid evolution and phenotypic plasticity, and a lack of large-scale and long-term monitoring. Recent genomic studies using the model species Arabidopsis predict that plastic and evolutionary changes in phenology may affect plant reproduction. We propose that three genomic-scale methods would enhance global change studies. First, genome-wide RNA sequencing enables monitoring of diverse functional traits and phenology.

15,"Bridging ecology and conservation: from ecological networks to ecosystem function
Summary
1. Current approaches to conservation may be inadequate to maintain ecosystem integrity because they are mostly based on rarity status of organisms rather than functional signifi- cance. Alternatively, approaches focusing on the protection of ecological networks lead to more appropriate conservation targets to maintain ecosystem integrity.
2. We propose that a shift in focus from species to interaction networks is necessary to achieve pressing conservation management and restoration ecology goals of conserving biodi- versity, ecosystem processes and ultimately landscape-scale delivery of ecosystem services.
3. Using topical examples from the literature, we discuss historical and conceptual advances, current challenges and ways to move forward. We also propose a road map to ecological net- work conservation, providing a novel ready to use approach to identify clear conservation targets with flexible data requirements.
4. Synthesis and applications. Integration of how environmental and spatial constraints affect the nature and strength of local interaction networks will improve our ability to predict their response to change and to conserve them.

15,"Comparing species interaction networks along environmental gradients
Knowledge of species composition and their interactions, in the form of interaction networks, is required to understand processes shaping their distribution over time and space. As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:141007,0.00396792544052,0.1010120138525962,0.02225680090487,0.0018563776975497,0.0023027313873171,0.0093562789261341,0.0020180523861199,0.0080559765920043,0.1332726329565048,0.0046765678562223,0.044329434633255,0.8326064348220825,0.0040381369180977,0.2804088294506073,0.9545714855194092,0.1463955789804458,0.0089769186452031,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Ecological succession drives the structural change of seed-rodent interaction networks in fragmented forests
While deforestation and fragmentation can cause massive species loss in forest ecosystems, forest regeneration can also drive successional changes in species composition. Although studies have sometimes documented the effects of these compositional changes on interspecific interactions, few studies have investigated changes in the structure of plant-animal networks. We investigated how interaction networks of assemblages of rodents and tree seeds changed with forest fragmentation and succession in a subtropical region. We compared seed-rodent interactions between 14 secondary forest patches that ranged in area from 2 to 58 ha, and from 10 to at least 100 years old, representing a successional gradient. We expected that deforestation and fragmentation would reduce seed production and diversify rodent communities, resulting in higher interaction strengths and connectivity, but weak nestedness (i.e., specialists interact with subsets of the species interaction of generalists). We measured the frequency of rodents eating and removing seeds (interaction strength) in each patch during 3 successive years, using seed tagging and infrared camera trapping, and calculated the properties of the seed-rodent networks. We found that the relative abundances of seeds and rodents changed with stand age not patch size, as did seed-rodent interactions: older patches produced more seeds, contained fewer individuals and species of rodents, and had seed-rodent networks with lower connectance and interaction strength, but higher nestedness. Connectance and interaction strength decreased with metabolic per capita seed availability (as measured by seed energy value); nestedness increased with seed richness, but decreased with rodent abundance. At species level, we found stand age and patch size showed significant effects on seed or rodent abundance of a few species. We also found seed coat thickness and starch contents had significant effects on network metrics. Our results suggest that during succession after deforestation, seed-rodent interactions in these sub-tropical forests change from a state dominated by high seed removal and highly connected seed-rodent networks to a state with more seeds and highly nested networks.

15,"How do cold-adapted plants respond to climatic cycles? Interglacial expansion explains current distribution and genomic diversity in Primula farinosa L
Understanding the effects of past climatic fluctuations on the distribution and population-size dynamics of cold-adapted species is essential for predicting their responses to ongoing global climate change. In spite of the heterogeneity of cold-adapted species, two main contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain their responses to Late Quaternary glacial cycles, namely, the interglacial contraction versus the interglacial expansion hypotheses. Here, we use the cold-adapted plant Primula farinosa to test two demographic models under each of the two alternative hypotheses and a fifth, null model. We first approximate the time and extent of demographic contractions and expansions during the Late Quaternary by projecting species distribution models across the last 72 ka. We also generate genome-wide sequence data using a Reduced Representation Library approach to reconstruct the spatial structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships of lineages within P. farinosa. Finally, by integrating the results of climatic and genomic analyses in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework, we propose the most likely model for the extent and direction of population-size changes in P. farinosa through the Late Quaternary. Our results support the interglacial expansion of P. farinosa, differing from the prevailing paradigm that the observed distribution of cold-adapted species currently fragmented in high altitude and latitude regions reflects the consequences of postglacial contraction processes.

15,"Knowing the past to forecast the future: a case study on a relictual, endemic species of the SW Alps, Berardia subacaulis
Future climate change may lead to a substantial loss of biodiversity, particularly affecting mountain regions, including the Alps. Range-size reduction in high mountain plant species is predicted to be more pronounced for endemic species. Investigating the broad temporal spectrum of range shifts is important for the conservation of biodiversity, since learning how species responded to climate change in the past provides useful insights on how they might react to warming trends in the present and future. Using species distribution models and an ensemble forecasting approach, we explored how the distribution of Berardia subacaulis, a monospecific genus endemic of the south-west Alps, may be affected by past and future projected climate change. During the last interglacial, the habitat suitability of Berardia was lower than present and a progressive increase was observed from the last glacial maximum until now. In the future, Berardia appears to lose more than 80 % of its range, becoming endangered by 2050. Our results suggest that Berardia probably survived past warmer periods in situ, expanding its distributional range during cooler periods. The severe future range contraction predicted for Berardia reflects similar results for other endemic species. As Berardia represents an interesting model species to evaluate the effects of climate warming on range size and shifts, demographic and precise range monitoring may be undertaken on this species.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:111309,0.0039530089125037,0.4440263509750366,0.0042009567841887,0.0016836709110066,0.0020115307997912,0.0270298663526773,0.0020821352954953,0.0065942024812102,0.00955206528306,0.0035286473575979,0.25418221950531,0.0615417622029781,0.982132852077484,0.2217691540718078,0.9851508736610411,0.0029304856434464,0.0094175208359956,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Phylogeny and biogeography of Primula sect. Armerina: implications for plant evolution under climate change and the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
BACKGROUND:  The historical orogenesis and associated climatic changes of mountain areas have been suggested to partly account for the occurrence of high levels of biodiversity and endemism. However, their effects on dispersal, differentiation and evolution of many groups of plants are still unknown. In this study, we examined the detailed diversification history of Primula sect. Armerina, and used biogeographic analysis and macro-evolutionary modeling to investigate a series of different questions concerning the evolution of the geographical and ecological distribution of the species in this section. RESULTS:  We sequenced five chloroplast and one nuclear genes for species of Primula sect. Armerina. Neither chloroplast nor nuclear trees support the monophyly of the section. The major incongruences between the two trees occur among closely related species and may be explained by hybridization. Our dating analyses based on the chloroplast dataset suggest that this section began to diverge from its relatives around 3.55 million years ago, largely coinciding with the last major uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Biogeographic analysis supports the origin of the section in the Himalayan Mountains and dispersal from the Himalayas to Northeastern QTP, Western QTP and Hengduan Mountains. Furthermore, evolutionary models of ecological niches show that the two P. fasciculata clades have significantly different climatic niche optima and rates of niche evolution, indicating niche evolution under climatic changes and further providing evidence for explaining their biogeographic patterns. CONCLUSION:  Our results support the hypothesis that geologic and climatic events play important roles in driving biological diversification of organisms in the QTP area. The Pliocene uplift of the QTP and following climatic changes most likely promoted both the inter- and intraspecific divergence of Primula sect. Armerina. This study also illustrates how niche evolution under climatic changes influences biogeographic patterns.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:112772,0.0040365378372371,0.6468543410301208,0.0198101587593555,0.0017672613030299,0.0020812656730413,0.2171630710363388,0.4913076162338257,0.0055922078900039,0.0092703206464648,0.0058900215663015,0.2730348408222198,0.0887255743145942,0.917482316493988,0.30573371052742,0.9695899486541748,0.0029527687001973,0.0092991907149553,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Ecosystem service change caused by climatological and non‐climatological drivers: A Swiss case study
Understanding the drivers of ecosystem change and their effects on ecosystem services are essential for management decisions and verification of progress towards national and international sustainability policies (e.g. Aichi Biodiversity Targets, Sustainable Development Goals). We aim to disentangle spatially the effect of climatological and non‐climatological drivers on ecosystem service supply and trends. Therefore, we explored time series of three ecosystem services in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014: carbon dioxide regulation, soil erosion prevention, and air quality regulation. We applied additive models to describe the spatial variation attributed to climatological (i.e. temperature, precipitation and relative sunshine duration) and non‐climatological drivers (i.e. random effects representing other spatially structured processes) that may affect ecosystem service change.
Obtained results indicated strong influences of climatological drivers on ecosystem service trends in Switzerland. We identified equal contributions of all three climatological drivers on trends of carbon dioxide regulation and soil erosion prevention, while air quality regulation was more strongly influenced by temperature. Additionally, our results showed that climatological and non‐climatological drivers affected ecosystem services both negatively and positively, depending on the regions (in particular lower and higher altitudinal areas), drivers, and services assessed.
Our findings highlight stronger effects of climatological compared to non‐climatological drivers on ecosystem service change in Switzerland. Furthermore, drivers of ecosystem change display a spatial heterogeneity in their influence on ecosystem service trends. We propose an approach building on an additive model to disentangle the effect of climatological and non‐climatological drivers on ecosystem service trends. Such analyses should be extended in the future to ecosystem service flow and demand to complete ecosystem service assessments and to demonstrate and communicate more clearly the benefits of ecosystem services for human well‐being.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170517,0.0041752732358872,0.0613798052072525,0.0142780831083655,0.0018320542294532,0.0022686449810862,0.4377426505088806,0.0020404895767569,0.0087224505841732,0.0293561797589063,0.0037305064033716,0.7214019894599915,0.610163688659668,0.927358627319336,0.0172096882015466,0.95611971616745,0.0029327925294637,0.8728662729263306,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Remote sensing of plant-water relations: An overview and future perspectives
Vegetation is a highly dynamic component of the Earth surface and substantially alters the water cycle. Particularly the process of oxygenic plant photosynthesis determines vegetation connecting the water and carbon cycle and causing various interactions and feedbacks across Earth spheres. While vegetation impacts the water cycle, it reacts to changing water availability via functional, biochemical and structural responses. Unravelling the resulting complex feedbacks and interactions between the plant-water system and environmental change is essential for any modelling approaches and predictions, but still insufficiently understood due to currently missing observations. We hypothesize that an appropriate cross-scale monitoring of plant-water relations can be achieved by combined observational and modelling approaches. This paper reviews suitable remote sensing approaches to assess plant-water relations ranging from pure observational to combined observational-modelling approaches. We use a combined energy balance and radiative transfer model to assess the explanatory power of pure observational approaches focussing on plant parameters to estimate plant-water relations, followed by an outline for a more effective use of remote sensing by their integration into soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) models. We apply a mechanistic model simulating water movement in the SPAC to reveal insight into the complexity of relations between soil, plant and atmospheric parameters, and thus plant water relations. We conclude that future research should focus on strategies combining observations and mechanistic modelling to advance our knowledge on the interplay between the plant-water system and environmental change, e.g. through plant transpiration.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:152153,0.0040483945049345,0.2748427987098694,0.0205301120877265,0.0019413399277254,0.0022257650271058,0.9953063130378724,0.5899239778518677,0.0076081193983554,0.0163207408040761,0.0034349325578659,0.0373223908245563,0.93878436088562,0.0040512545965611,0.026772528886795,0.5432641506195068,0.0029497027862817,0.0094588156789541,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Spatio-temporal trends and trade-offs in ecosystem services: An Earth observation based assessment for Switzerland between 2004 and 2014
Understanding and monitoring pressures on ecosystems and their consequences for ecosystem services (ES) is essential for management decisions and verification of progress towards national and international policies (e.g. Aichi Biodiversity Targets, Sustainable Development Goals). Remote sensing (RS) offers a unique capability to assess ES systematically and regularly across spatial and temporal scales. We aim to evaluate the benefits of RS to monitor spatio-temporal variations of ES by assessing several ES in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014. We coupled mechanistic ES models and RS data to estimate time series of three regulating (i.e. carbon dioxide regulation (CO₂R), soil erosion prevention (SEP), and air quality regulation (AQR)) and one cultural ES (re- creational hiking (RH)). The resulting ES were used to assess spatial and temporal changes, trade-offs and sy- nergies of ES potential supply and flow in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014. Resulting ES trends showed diverse spatial patterns across Switzerland with largest changes in CO₂R and AQR. ES interactions revealed a scale and elevation dependency. We identified weak to strong synergies between all ES combinations except for trade-offs between CO₂R–AQR and AQR–RH at Swiss scale. Spatially, all ES interactions revealed a hetero- geneous mix of synergies and trade-offs within Switzerland.
Our results demonstrate the strength of RS for systematic and regular spatio-temporal ES monitoring and contribute insights to the large potential of RS, which will be extended with future Earth observation missions.

15,"Evaluating the environmental parameters that determine aerobic biodegradation half-lives of pesticides in soil with a multivariable approach
Aerobic biodegradation half-lives (half-lives) are key parameters used to evaluate pesticide persistence in soil. However, half-life estimates for individual pesticides often span several orders of magnitude, reflecting the impact that various environmental or experimental parameters have on half-lives in soil. In this work, we collected literature-reported half-lives for eleven pesticides along with associated metadata describing the environmental or experimental conditions under which they were derived. We then developed a multivariable framework to discover relationships between the half-lives and associated metadata. We first compared data for the herbicide atrazine collected from 95 laboratory and 65 field studies. We discovered that atrazine application history and soil texture were the parameters that have the largest influence on the observed half-lives in both types of studies. We then extended the analysis to include ten additional pesticides with data collected exclusively from laboratory studies. We found that, when data were available, pesticide application history and biomass concentrations were always positively associated with half-lives. The relevance of other parameters varied among the pesticides, but in some cases the variability could be explained by the physicochemical properties of the pesticides. For example, we found that the relative significance of the organic carbon content of soil for determining half-lives depends on the relative solubility of the pesticide. Altogether, our analyses highlight the reciprocal influence of both environmental parameters and intrinsic physicochemical properties for determining half-lives in soil. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

15,"Ion trapping of amines in protozoa: a novel removal mechanism for micropollutants in activated sludge
To optimize removal of organic micropollutants from the water cycle, understanding the processes during activated sludge treatment is essential. In this study, we hypothesize that aliphatic amines, which are highly abundant among organic micropollutants, are partly removed from the water phase in activated sludge through ion trapping in protozoa. In ion trapping, which has been extensively investigated in medical research, the neutral species of amine-containing compounds diffuse through the cell membrane and further into acidic vesicles present in eukaryotic cells such as protozoa. There they become trapped because diffusion of the positively charged species formed in the acidic vesicles is strongly hindered. We tested our hypothesis with two experiments. First, we studied the distribution of the fluorescent amine acridine orange in activated sludge by confocal fluorescence imaging. We observed intense fluorescence in distinct compartments of the protozoa, but not in the bacterial biomass. Second, we investigated the distribution of 12 amine-containing and eight control micropollutants in both regular activated sludge and sludge where the protozoa had been inactivated. In contrast to most control compounds, the amine-containing micropollutants displayed a distinctly different behavior in the noninhibited sludge compared to the inhibited one: (i) more removal from the liquid phase; (ii) deviation from first-order kinetics for the removal from the liquid phase; and (iii) higher amounts in the solid phase. These results provide strong evidence that ion trapping in protozoa occurs and that it is an important removal mechanism for amine-containing micropollutants in batch experiments with activated sludge that has so far gone unnoticed. We expect that our findings will trigger further investigations on the importance of this process in full-scale wastewater treatment systems, including its relevance for accumulation of ammonium.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:143804,0.0039906916208565,0.0089116403833031,0.1259528994560241,0.0016076058382168,0.0021342479158192,0.9970715045928956,0.6258853673934937,0.0051603550091385,0.0096110003069043,0.0075818970799446,0.0220381785184144,0.8252148628234863,0.0052013332024216,0.2387319803237915,0.0209183786064386,0.003050573170185,0.0094355847686529,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Modeling the spatial dependence of floods using the Fisher copula
Floods often affect not only a single location, but also a whole region. Flood frequency analysis should therefore be undertaken at a regional scale which requires the considerations of the dependence of events at different locations. This dependence is often neglected even though its consideration is essential to derive reliable flood estimates. A model used in regional multivariate frequency analysis should ideally consider the dependence of events at multiple sites which might show dependence in the lower and/or upper tail of the distribution. We here seek to propose a simple model that on the one hand considers this dependence with respect to the network structure of the region and on the other hand allows for the simulation of stochastic event sets at both gauged and ungauged locations. The new Fisher copula model is used for representing the spatial dependence of flood events in the nested Thur catchment in Switzerland. Flood event samples generated for the gauged stations using the Fisher copula are compared to samples generated by other dependence models allowing for modeling of multivariate data including elliptical copulas, R-vine copulas, and max-stable models. The comparison of the dependence structures of the generated samples shows that the Fisher copula is a suitable model for capturing the spatial dependence in the data. We therefore use the copula in a way such that it can be used in an interpolation context to simulate event sets comprising gauged and ungauged locations. The spatial event sets generated using the Fisher copula well capture the general dependence structure in the data and the upper tail dependence, which is of particular interest when looking at extreme flood events and when extrapolating to higher return periods. The Fisher copula was for a medium-sized catchment found to be a suitable model for the stochastic simulation of flood event sets at multiple gauged and ungauged locations.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170221,0.0039669759571552,0.0714966207742691,0.0119806239381432,0.0018698570784181,0.0023240312002599,0.7569225430488586,0.0024069987703114,0.0070359730161726,0.0090386942028999,0.0048340139910578,0.6425487995147705,0.052818089723587,0.788957417011261,0.9734029173851012,0.2272244393825531,0.0030122173484414,0.0092014893889427,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Modeling temporally evolving and spatially globally dependent data
The last decades have seen an unprecedented increase in the availability of data sets that are inherently global and temporally evolving, from remotely sensed networks to climate model ensembles. This paper provides an overview of statistical modeling techniques for space–time processes, where space is the sphere representing our planet. In particular, we make a distintion between (a) second order‐based approaches and (b) practical approaches to modeling temporally evolving global processes. The former approaches are based on the specification of a class of space–time covariance functions, with space being the two‐dimensional sphere. The latter are based on explicit description of the dynamics of the space–time process, that is, by specifying its evolution as a function of its past history with added spatially dependent noise. We focus primarily on approach (a), for which the literature has been sparse. We provide new models of space–time covariance functions for random fields defined on spheres cross time. Practical approaches (b) are also discussed, with special emphasis on models built directly on the sphere, without projecting spherical coordinates onto the plane. We present a case study focused on the analysis of air pollution from the 2015 wildfires in Equatorial Asia, an event that was classified as the year's worst environmental disaster.

15,"Predicting missing values in spatio-temporal remote sensing data
Continuous, consistent, and long time-series from remote sensing are essential to monitoring changes on Earth's surface. However, analyzing such data sets is often challenging due to missing values introduced by cloud cover, missing orbits, sensor geometry artifacts, and so on. We propose a new and accurate spatio-temporal prediction method to replace missing values in remote sensing data sets. The method exploits the spatial coherence and temporal seasonal regularity that are inherent in many data sets. The key parts of the method are: 1) the adaptively chosen spatio-temporal subsets around missing values; 2) the ranking of images within the subsets based on a scoring algorithm; 3) the estimation of empirical quantiles characterizing the missing values; and 4) the prediction of missing values through quantile regression. One advantage of quantile regression is the robustness to outliers, which enables more accurate parameter retrieval in the analysis of remote sensing data sets. In addition, we provide bootstrap-based quantification of prediction uncertainties.

15,"Integrative research efforts at the boundary of biodiversity and global change research
Global environmental change and biodiversity loss are closely linked through different feedback mechanisms. The University of Zurich Research Priority Programme on ‘Global Change and Biodiversity’ approach is to work with interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity to integrate mechanisms of interactions, feedback and scale and improve our understanding of the feedbacks between global change and biodiversity effects. Such work across research disciplines is not without its challenges. Here we share some of the questions that arose from our research approach over the last five years and how we addressed these challenges. First, our transdisciplinary approach allows combining different disciplines into a more holistic perspective towards integrative research, but demands collaborative work to establish common terminology, concepts, and metrics. Second, the research theme's common perspective (biodiversity is desirable, global change is not) may also induce a confirmation bias from preconceived ideas. Third, new challenges emerge from scaling mechanisms and feedbacks at different spatial and temporal scales. Fourth, we investigate how to relate biodiversity, global change, ecosystem services and functions using interdisciplinary approaches. Fifth, we identify gaps between existing experiments and data requirements, and propose the definition of new experimental setups by linking processes and performing experiments at typical experimental scales as well as at larger scales. We conclude by emphasising the necessity to integrate theory, experiments, modelling and simulation, high performance computing and big data to understand feedbacks between biodiversity loss and processes of global change.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:151858,0.0039077550172805,0.0110519053414464,0.0083954771980643,0.0315313339233398,0.0023537222295999,0.0151385692879557,0.001932414365001,0.0130441216751933,0.5973935723304749,0.0120698371902108,0.1497736126184463,0.3924744725227356,0.0087696900591254,0.1925678998231887,0.9730958938598632,0.0041820770129561,0.8694983720779419,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Genetics of dispersal
Dispersal is a process of central importance for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations and communities, because of its diverse consequences for gene flow and demography. It is subject to evolutionary change, which begs the question, what is the genetic basis of this potentially complex trait? To address this question, we (i) review the empirical literature on the genetic basis of dispersal, (ii) explore how theoretical investigations of the evolution of dispersal have represented the genetics of dispersal, and (iii) discuss how the genetic basis of dispersal influences theoretical predictions of the evolution of dispersal and potential consequences. Dispersal has a detectable genetic basis in many organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. Generally, there is evidence for significant genetic variation for dispersal or dispersal-related phenotypes or evidence for the micro-evolution of dispersal in natural populations. Dispersal is typically the outcome of several interacting traits, and this complexity is reflected in its genetic architecture: while some genes of moderate to large effect can influence certain aspects of dispersal, dispersal traits are typically polygenic. Correlations among dispersal traits as well as between dispersal traits and other traits under selection are common, and the genetic basis of dispersal can be highly environment-dependent. By contrast, models have historically considered a highly simplified genetic architecture of dispersal. It is only recently that models have started to consider multiple loci influencing dispersal, as well as non-additive effects such as dominance and epistasis, showing that the genetic basis of dispersal can influence evolutionary rates and outcomes, especially under non-equilibrium conditions. For example, the number of loci controlling dispersal can influence projected rates of dispersal evolution during range shifts and corresponding demographic impacts. Incorporating more realism in the genetic architecture of dispersal is thus necessary to enable models to move beyond the purely theoretical towards making more useful predictions of evolutionary and ecological dynamics under current and future environmental conditions. To inform these advances, empirical studies need to answer outstanding questions concerning whether specific genes underlie dispersal variation, the genetic architecture of context-dependent dispersal phenotypes and behaviours, and correlations among dispersal and other traits.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:139433,0.0039379820227622,0.7359589338302612,0.012410475872457,0.0039694430306553,0.0025887202937155,0.0247342456132173,0.0020410565193742,0.0085050072520971,0.0772927701473236,0.8171648979187012,0.0784734338521957,0.7597228288650513,0.0041403546929359,0.2218709737062454,0.8094999194145203,0.0047157322987914,0.0121849104762077,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Can Evolution Supply What Ecology Demands?
A simplistic view of the adaptive process pictures a hillside along which a population can climb: when ecological ‘demands’ change, evolution ‘supplies’ the variation needed for the population to climb to a new peak. Evolutionary ecologists point out that this simplistic view can be incomplete because the fitness landscape changes dynamically as the population evolves. Geneticists meanwhile have identified complexities relating to the nature of genetic variation and its architecture, and the importance of epigenetic variation is under debate. In this review, we highlight how complexity in both ecological ‘demands’ and the evolutionary ‘supply’ influences organisms’ ability to climb fitness landscapes that themselves change dynamically as evolution proceeds, and encourage new synthetic effort across research disciplines towards ecologically realistic studies of adaptation.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:133230,0.003833259223029,0.0498330481350421,0.0084885330870747,0.0015288529684767,0.0027658024337142,0.0064791315235197,0.0020047228317707,0.0071759610436856,0.008675530552864,0.0298404768109321,0.5335026383399963,0.167968064546585,0.0103333787992596,0.2045129239559173,0.9800024032592772,0.0029194136150181,0.0084566185250878,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Geological and climatic influences on mountain biodiversity
Mountains are key features of the Earth’s surface and host a substantial proportion of the world’s species. However, the links between the evolution and distribution of biodiversity and the formation of mountains remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate multiple datasets to assess the relationships between species richness in mountains, geology and climate at global and regional scales. Specifically, we analyse how erosion, relief, soil and climate relate to the geographical distribution of terrestrial tetrapods, which include amphibians, birds and mammals. We find that centres of species richness correlate with areas of high temperatures, annual rainfall and topographic relief, supporting previous studies. We unveil additional links between mountain-building processes and biodiversity: species richness correlates with erosion rates and heterogeneity of soil types, with a varying response across continents. These additional links are prominent but under-explored, and probably relate to the interplay between surface uplift, climate change and atmospheric circulation through time. They are also influenced by the location and orientation of mountain ranges in relation to air circulation patterns, and how species diversification, dispersal and refugia respond to climate change. A better understanding of biosphere–lithosphere interactions is needed to understand the patterns and evolution of mountain biodiversity across space and time.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:156904,0.0039640190079808,0.0408945940434932,0.0086985668167471,0.0019731167703866,0.002109772991389,0.0407981351017952,0.2542692720890045,0.0058108759112656,0.0096388813108205,0.0035438404884189,0.8787311315536499,0.0497672148048877,0.9545502066612244,0.6190789937973022,0.9667693972587584,0.0029759434983134,0.0097039798274636,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Sperm form and function: what do we know about the role of sexual selection?
Sperm morphological variation has attracted considerable interest and generated a wealth of (mostly descriptive) studies over the past three centuries. Yet, apart from biophysical studies linking sperm morphology to swimming velocity, surprisingly little is known about the adaptive significance of sperm form and the selective processes underlying its tremendous diversification throughout the animal kingdom. Here, we first discuss the challenges of examining sperm morphology in an evolutionary context and why our understanding of it is still so poor. Then, we review empirical evidence for how sexual selection theory applies to the evolution of sperm form and function, including putative secondary sexual traits borne by sperm.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:149729,0.9947364926338196,0.0499532930552959,0.0103383446112275,0.0552562624216079,0.9925010800361632,0.545337438583374,0.1076293140649795,0.0143951708450913,0.0122955841943621,0.0769092440605163,0.0266241617500782,0.0596064217388629,0.0038896754849702,0.9305400252342224,0.1040430068969726,0.0609280057251453,0.0092767439782619,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"The evolution of male-biased sexual size dimorphism is associated with increased body size plasticity in males
1. Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) can vary drastically across environments, demonstrating pronounced sex-specific plasticity. In insects, females are usually the larger and more plastic sex. However, the shortage of taxa with male-biased SSD hampers the assessment of whether the greater plasticity in females is driven by selection on size or represents an effect of the female reproductive role. Here, we specifically address the role of sex-specific plasticity of body size in the evolution of SSD reversals to disentangle sex and size effects.
2. We first investigate sex-specific body size plasticity in Sepsis punctum and Sepsis neocynipsea as two independent cases of intraspecific SSD reversals in sepsid flies. In both species, directional variation in SSD between populations is driven by stronger sexual selection on male size. Using controlled laboratory breeding, we find evidence for sex-specific plasticity and increased condition dependence of male size in populations with male-biased SSD, but not of female size in populations with female-biased SSD.
3. To extend the comparative scope, we next estimate sex-specific body size plasticity in eight additional fly species that differ in the direction of SSD under laboratory conditions. In all species with male-biased SSD we find males to be the more plastic sex, while this was only rarely the case in species with female-biased SSD, thus suggesting a more general trend in Diptera.
4. To examine the generality of this pattern in holometabolous insects, we combine our data with data from the literature in a meta-analysis. Again, male body size tends to be more plastic than female size when males are the larger sex, though female size is now also generally more plastic when females are larger.
5. Our findings indicate that primarily selection on size, rather than the reproductive role per se, drives the evolution of sex-specific body size plasticity. However, sepsid flies, and possibly Diptera in general, show a clear sexual asymmetry with greater male than female plasticity related to SSD, likely driven by strong sexual selection on males. Although further research controlling for phylogenetic and ecological confounding effects is needed, our findings are congruent with theory in suggesting that condition dependence plays a pivotal role in the evolution of sexual size dimorphism.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:142657,0.0038910482544451,0.1416390836238861,0.0345541946589946,0.0045917923562228,0.9896194338798524,0.0073011354543268,0.0022423302289098,0.0080809500068426,0.0090074026957154,0.1745548844337463,0.0244320388883352,0.1885933727025985,0.0043103820644319,0.9287634491920472,0.4521055221557617,0.0038477403577417,0.0097688594833016,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Spatial structure of foraging meerkat groups is affected by both social and ecological factors
Group-living animals need to trade off the benefits and the costs of close proximity to conspecifics. Benefits can be increased, and costs reduced by preferentially choosing specific locations within a group best adjusted to an individual’s needs or by associating with specific group members and/or avoiding others. We investigated the spatial structure of meerkat (Suricata suricatta) groups and whether it was shaped by social factors such as affiliation or aggression among group members, predation risk, foraging success, or a mix of these different factors. Using social network analyses, based on spatial networks, we found associations between the dominant pair, among males and among same aged individuals, and dis-assortment by sex only in one to two of the six groups. In addition, the structure of meerkat groups was highly variable, as individual strength within the calculated networks was not repeatable over time. Meerkats seemed to adjust their location to their physical environment, as dominant individuals were located further toward the front of the group, where foraging success is likely higher and young individuals located further toward the back of the group, where they can benefit most from the vigilance effort of their conspecifics. We conclude that meerkat groups display a dynamic spatial structure depending on both the current social and physical environmental.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168280,0.0035152076743543,0.1206424012780189,0.0469500720500946,0.0015184950316324,0.9362472891807556,0.0145067488774657,0.0021222296636551,0.0443144589662551,0.0087422551587224,0.7048203349113464,0.0824954360723495,0.3860840797424316,0.0041475528851151,0.8292047381401062,0.5551275610923767,0.3808186650276184,0.0097764087840914,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Use of the sun as a heading indicator when caching and recovering in a wild rodent
A number of diurnal species have been shown to use directional information from the sun to orientate. The use of the sun in this way has been suggested to occur in either a time-dependent (relying on specific positional information) or a time-compensated manner (a compass that adjusts itself over time with the shifts in the sun’s position). However, some interplay may occur between the two where a species could also use the sun in a time-limited way, whereby animals acquire certain information about the change of position, but do not show full compensational abilities. We tested whether Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) use the sun as an orientation marker to provide information for caching and recovery. This species is a social sciurid that inhabits arid, sparsely vegetated habitats in Southern Africa, where the sun is nearly always visible during the diurnal period. Due to the lack of obvious landmarks, we predicted that they might use positional cues from the sun in the sky as a reference point when caching and recovering food items. We provide evidence that Cape ground squirrels use information from the sun’s position while caching and reuse this information in a time-limited way when recovering these caches.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:134986,0.0038297427818179,0.8402648568153381,0.0052640251815319,0.0015927507774904,0.0018109641969203,0.0260905716568231,0.0025090898852795,0.0064261453226208,0.0089451000094413,0.0959618240594863,0.3330329656600952,0.6544106006622314,0.0037286102306097,0.9511640667915344,0.8557345867156982,0.0029185183811932,0.0105666043236851,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."

15,"A plant biodiversity effect resolved to a single chromosomal region
Despite extensive evidence that biodiversity promotes plant community productivity, progress towards understanding the mechanistic basis of this effect remains slow, impeding the development of predictive ecological theory and agricultural applications. Here, we analysed non-additive interactions between genetically divergent Arabidopsis accessions in experimental plant communities. By combining methods from ecology and quantitative genetics, we identify a major effect locus at which allelic differences between individuals increase the above-ground productivity of communities. In experiments with near-isogenic lines, we show that this diversity effect acts independently of other genomic regions and can be resolved to a single region representing less than 0.3% of the genome. Using plant–soil feedback experiments, we also demonstrate that allelic diversity causes genotype-specific soil legacy responses in a consecutive growing period, even after the original community has disappeared. Our work thus suggests that positive diversity effects can be linked to single Mendelian factors, and that a range of complex community properties can have a simple cause. This may pave the way to novel breeding strategies, focusing on phenotypic properties that manifest themselves beyond isolated individuals; that is, at a higher level of biological organization.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:165578,0.003956664353609,0.9920056462287904,0.0221097003668546,0.0017795414896681,0.0023290396202355,0.0167275425046682,0.0020069172605872,0.9341599941253662,0.0094873839989304,0.0156277008354663,0.0317279323935508,0.6800956726074219,0.003953973762691,0.0502708256244659,0.9808797240257264,0.0029285901691764,0.0086706103757023,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."

Biodiversity experiments have shown that species loss reduces ecosystem functioning in grassland.

Simulating multiple extinction scenarios, we found that richness strongly increased stand-level productivity. After 8 years, 16-species mixtures had accumulated over twice the amount of carbon found in average monocultures and similar amounts as those of two commercial monocultures.

15,"Positive diversity-functioning relationships in model communities of methanotrophic bacteria
Biodiversity enhances ecosystem functions such as biomass production and nutrient cycling. Although the majority of the terrestrial biodiversity is hidden in soils, very little is known about the importance of the diversity of microbial communities for soil functioning. Here, we tested effects of biodiversity on the functioning of methanotrophs, a specialized group of soil bacteria that plays a key role in mediating greenhouse gas emissions from soils. Using pure strains of methanotrophic bacteria, we assembled artificial communities of different diversity levels, with which we inoculated sterile soil microcosms. To assess the functioning of these communities, we measured methane oxidation by gas chromatography throughout the experiment and determined changes in community composition and community size at several time points by quantitative PCR and sequencing. We demonstrate that microbial diversity had a positive overyielding effect on methane oxidation, in particular at the beginning of the experiment. This higher assimilation of CH4 at high diversity translated into increased growth and significantly larger communities towards the end of the study. The overyielding of mixtures with respect to CH4 consumption and community size were positively correlated. The temporal CH4 consumption profiles of strain monocultures differed, raising the possibility that temporal complementarity of component strains drove the observed community-level strain richness effects; however, the community niche metric we derived from the temporal activity profiles did not explain the observed strain richness effect. The strain richness effect also was unrelated to both the phylogenetic and functional trait diversity of mixed communities. Overall, our results suggest that positive biodiversity–ecosystem-function relationships show similar patterns across different scales and may be widespread in nature. Additionally, biodiversity is probably also important in natural methanotrophic communities for the ecosystem function methane oxidation.

15,"Biodiversity promotes primary productivity and growing season lengthening at the landscape scale
Experiments have shown positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships in small plots with model communities established from species pools typically comprising few dozen species. Whether patterns found can be extrapolated to complex, nonexperimental, real-world landscapes that provide ecosystem services to humans remains unclear. Here, we combine species inventories from a large-scale network of 447 1-km2 plots with remotely sensed indices of primary productivity (years 2000–2015). We show that landscape-scale productivity and its temporal stability increase with the diversity of plants and other taxa. Effects of biodiversity indicators on productivity were comparable in size to effects of other important drivers related to climate, topography, and land cover. These effects occurred in plots that integrated different ecosystem types (i.e., metaecosystems) and were consistent over vast environmental and altitudinal gradients. The BEF relations we report are as strong or even exceed the ones found in small-scale experiments, despite different community assembly processes and a species pool comprising nearly 2,000 vascular plant species. Growing season length increased progressively over the observation period, and this shift was accelerated in more diverse plots, suggesting that a large species pool is important for adaption to climate change. Our study further implies that abiotic global-change drivers may mediate ecosystem functioning through biodiversity changes.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:142669,0.0042261099442839,0.2009313255548477,0.0108645632863044,0.0020713165868073,0.0020616541150957,0.1211243867874145,0.0020730344112962,0.94258850812912,0.0091514876112341,0.0035646543838083,0.233970820903778,0.5058168768882751,0.9591175317764282,0.0998030602931976,0.9899627566337584,0.0029394750017672,0.0093125291168689,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"On the combined effect of soil fertility and topography on tree growth in subtropical forest ecosystems - a study from SE China
Aims: The aim of our research was to understand small-scale effects of topography and soil fertility on tree growth in a forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment in subtropical SE China.
Methods: Geomorphometric terrain analyses were carried out at a spatial resolution of 5×5 m. Soil samples of different depth increments and data on tree height were collected from a total of 566 plots (667 m2 each). The soils were analyzed for carbon (soil organic carbon [SOC]), nitrogen, acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations and base saturation as soil fertility attributes. All plots were classified into geomorphological units. Analyses of variance and linear regressions were applied to all terrain, soil fertility and tree growth attributes.
Important Findings: In general, young and shallow soils and relatively small differences in stable soil properties suggest that soil erosion has truncated the soils to a large extent over the whole area of the experiment. This explains the concurrently increasing CEC and SOC stocks downslope, in hollows and in valleys. However, colluvial, carbon-rich sediments are missing widely due to the convexity of the footslopes caused by uplift and removal of eroded sediments by adjacent waterways. The results showed that soil fertility is mainly influenced by topography. Monte–Carlo flow accumulation (MCCA), curvature, slope and aspect significantly affected soil fertility. Furthermore, soil fertility was affected by the different geomorphological positions on the experimental sites with ridge and spur positions showing lower exchangeable base cation contents, especially potassium (K), due to leaching. This geomorphological effect of soil fertility is most pronounced in the topsoil and decreases when considering the subsoil down to 50cm depth. Few soil fertility attributes affect tree height after 1–2 years of growth, among which C stocks proved to be most important while pHKCl and CEC only played minor roles. Nevertheless, soil acidity and a high proportion of Al on the exchange complex affected tree height even after only 1–2 years growth. Hence, our study showed that forest nutrition is coupled to a recycling of litter nutrients, and does not only depend on subsequent supply of nutrients from the mineral soil. Besides soil fertility, topography affected tree height. We found that especially MCCA as indicator of water availability affected tree growth at small-scale, as well as aspect. Overall, our synthesis on the interrelation between fertility, topography and tree growth in a subtropical forest ecosystem in SE China showed that topographic heterogeneity lead to ecological gradients across geomorphological positions. In this respect, small-scale soil–plant interactions in a young forest can serve as a driver for the future development of vegetation and biodiversity control on soil fertility. In addition, it shows that terrain attributes should be accounted for in ecological research.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:145140,0.004198248963803,0.6505064368247986,0.0177576709538698,0.002029926283285,0.0021373883355408,0.8756816387176514,0.0022074927110224,0.0053856349550187,0.0088461795821785,0.0035187541507184,0.206090971827507,0.7237359881401062,0.0039865202270448,0.5110645890235901,0.9427099227905272,0.0029998200479894,0.0092236995697021,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Toward a methodical framework for comprehensively assessing forest multifunctionality
Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research has extended its scope from communities that are short-lived or reshape their structure annually to structurally complex forest ecosystems. The establishment of tree diversity experiments poses specific methodological challenges for assessing the multiple functions provided by forest ecosystems. In particular, methodological inconsistencies and nonstandardized protocols impede the analysis of multifunctionality within, and comparability across the increasing number of tree diversity experiments. By providing an overview on key methods currently applied in one of the largest forest biodiversity experiments, we show how methods differing in scale and simplicity can be combined to retrieve consistent data allowing novel insights into forest ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, we discuss and develop recommendations for the integration and transferability of diverse methodical approaches to present and future forest biodiversity experiments. We identified four principles that should guide basic decisions concerning method selection for tree diversity experiments and forest BEF research: (1) method selection should be directed toward maximizing data density to increase the number of measured variables in each plot. (2) Methods should cover all relevant scales of the experiment to consider scale dependencies of biodiversity effects. (3) The same variable should be evaluated with the same method across space and time for adequate larger-scale and longer-time data analysis and to reduce errors due to changing measurement protocols. (4) Standardized, practical and rapid methods for assessing biodiversity and ecosystem functions should be promoted to increase comparability among forest BEF experiments. We demonstrate that currently available methods provide us with a sophisticated toolbox to improve a synergistic understanding of forest multifunctionality. However, these methods require further adjustment to the specific requirements of structurally complex and long-lived forest ecosystems. By applying methods connecting relevant scales, trophic levels, and above- and belowground ecosystem compartments, knowledge gain from large tree diversity experiments can be optimized.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:145143,0.0041580144315958,0.0093565750867128,0.0200779177248477,0.0018100767629221,0.0021956332493573,0.0281537249684333,0.0019801256712526,0.0075843804515898,0.0090879267081618,0.0035027146805077,0.0385800898075103,0.1825960427522659,0.0036947797052562,0.0431696400046348,0.9928382039070128,0.0028170992154628,0.0088273771107196,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Biodiversity increases the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate extremes
It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide1. Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities2. However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50% during climate events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16–32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25%. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high- and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability14, and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:126029,0.0041472264565527,0.1255300343036651,0.0067354319617152,0.0018016323447227,0.0020550426561385,0.939739465713501,0.0019850952085107,0.943983256816864,0.0088485218584537,0.0037415472324937,0.044517807662487,0.3635130822658539,0.9752711057662964,0.0980465710163116,0.9671359062194824,0.0030056056566536,0.0093013178557157,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Life history responses of meerkats to seasonal changes in extreme environments
Species in extreme habitats increasingly face changes in seasonal climate, but the demographic mechanisms through which these changes affect population persistence remain unknown. We investigated how changes in seasonal rainfall and temperature influence vital rates and viability of an arid environment specialist, the Kalahari meerkat, through effects on body mass. We show that climate change–induced reduction in adult mass in the prebreeding season would decrease fecundity during the breeding season and increase extinction risk, particularly at low population densities. In contrast, a warmer nonbreeding season resulting in increased mass and survival would buffer negative effects of reduced rainfall during the breeding season, ensuring persistence. Because most ecosystems undergo seasonal climate variations, a full understanding of species vulnerability to global change relies on linking seasonal trait and population dynamics.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168416,0.0039604208432137,0.2809076607227325,0.0069565121084451,0.0020197057165205,0.0021236513275653,0.3719295859336853,0.002048096852377,0.0055340435355901,0.0095238341018557,0.0138799417763948,0.1016171500086784,0.6300616264343262,0.9807552099227904,0.9009895324707032,0.5842827558517456,0.0030953779350966,0.0086670173332095,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Density feedbacks mediate effects of environmental change on population dynamics of a semidesert rodent
Population dynamics are the result of an interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic environmental drivers. Predicting the effects of environmental change on wildlife populations therefore requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms through which different environmental drivers interact to generate changes in population size and structure.
    In this study, we disentangled the roles of temperature, food availability and population density in shaping short‐ and long‐term population dynamics of the African striped mouse, a small rodent inhabiting a semidesert with high intra‐ and interannual variation in environmental conditions.
    We parameterized a female‐only stage‐structured matrix population model with vital rates depending on temperature, food availability and population density, using monthly mark–recapture data from 1609 mice trapped over 9 years (2005–2014). We then applied perturbation analyses to determine relative strengths and demographic pathways of these drivers in affecting population dynamics. Furthermore, we used stochastic population projections to gain insights into how three different climate change scenarios might affect size, structure and persistence of this population.
    We identified food availability, acting through reproduction, as the main driver of changes in both short‐ and long‐term population dynamics. This mechanism was mediated by strong density feedbacks, which stabilized the population after high peaks and allowed it to recover from detrimental crashes. Density dependence thus buffered the population against environmental change, and even adverse climate change scenarios were predicted to have little effect on population persistence (extinction risk over 100 years <5%) despite leading to overall lower abundances.
    Explicitly linking environment–demography relationships to population dynamics allowed us to accurately capture past population dynamics. It further enabled establishing the roles and relative importances of extrinsic and intrinsic environmental drivers, and we conclude that doing this is essential when investigating impacts of climate change on wildlife populations.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168420,0.0039446516893804,0.8612968325614929,0.0049652601592242,0.001819560304284,0.8304417729377747,0.004955040756613,0.0020790779963135,0.0063053499907255,0.0091467415913939,0.2211238145828247,0.0534286201000213,0.6146777272224426,0.9623985290527344,0.4807691276073456,0.9398351907730104,0.1050249859690666,0.0265018139034509,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Interactive life-history traits predict sensitivity of plants and animals to temporal autocorrelation
Temporal autocorrelation in demographic processes is an important aspect of population dynamics, but a comprehensive examination of its effects on different life-history strategies is lacking. We use matrix population models from 454 plant and animal populations to simulate stochastic population growth rates (log λs) under different temporal autocorrelations in demographic rates, using simulated and observed covariation among rates. We then test for differences in sensitivities, or changes of log λs to changes in autocorrelation among two major axes of life-history strategies, obtained from phylogenetically informed principal component analysis: the fast-slow and reproductive-strategy continua. Fast life histories exhibit highest sensitivities to simulated autocorrelation in demographic rates across reproductive strategies. Slow life histories are less sensitive to temporal autocorrelation, but their sensitivities increase among highly iteroparous species. We provide cross-taxonomic evidence that changes in the autocorrelation of environmental variation may affect a wide range of species, depending on complex interactions of life-history strategies.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:147801,0.0038306911010295,0.7282206416130066,0.1381115764379501,0.0015285820700228,0.7941770553588867,0.0464226640760898,0.0020930275786668,0.0116350445896387,0.0092372577637434,0.3868557214736938,0.0219554770737886,0.8877727389335632,0.0044826287776231,0.0835834518074989,0.7669366598129272,0.0029933040495961,0.3177933990955353,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Patterns of activity and body temperature of Aldabra giant tortoises in relation to environmental temperature
We studied the temperature relations of wild and zoo Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) focusing on (1) the relationship between environmental temperature and tortoise activity patterns (n = 8 wild individuals) and (2) on tortoise body temperature fluctuations, including how their core and external body temperatures vary in relation to different environmental temperature ranges (seasons; n = 4 wild and n = 5 zoo individuals). In addition, we surveyed the literature to review the effect of body mass on core body temperature range in relation to environmental temperature in the Testudinidae. Diurnal activity of tortoises was bimodally distributed and influenced by environmental temperature and season. The mean air temperature at which activity is maximized was 27.9°C, with a range of 25.8–31.7°C. Furthermore, air temperature explained changes in the core body temperature better than did mass, and only during the coldest trial, did tortoises with higher mass show more stable temperatures. Our results, together with the overall Testudinidae overview, suggest that, once variation in environmental temperature has been taken into account, there is little effect of mass on the temperature stability of tortoises. Moreover, the presence of thermal inertia in an individual tortoise depends on the environmental temperatures, and we found no evidence for inertial homeothermy. Finally, patterns of core and external body temperatures in comparison with environmental temperatures suggest that Aldabra giant tortoises act as mixed conformer–regulators.

15,"Modeling adaptive and nonadaptive responses of populations to environmental change
Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental change can generate both population-level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or nonadaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends on whether plastic responses are adaptive or nonadaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change or whether simpler nonevolutionary models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:148136,0.0038251962978392,0.056241001933813,0.0090501308441162,0.0015899991849437,0.0022518236655741,0.0061204661615192,0.0019764774478971,0.0082221459597349,0.0109088961035013,0.0595043562352657,0.0574235133826732,0.8817751407623291,0.0036644623614847,0.2227743715047836,0.8124397993087769,0.0028642646502703,0.0082533583045005,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Anthropogenic food resources foster the coexistence of distinct life history strategies: year-round sedentary and migratory brown bears
Plastic behavioral adaptation to human activities can result in the enhancement and establishment of distinct behavioral types within a population. Such inter-individual behavioral variations, if unaccounted for, can lead to biases in our understanding of species’ feeding habits, movement pattern, and habitat selection. We tracked the movements of 16 adult brown bears in a small and isolated population in northeast Turkey to i) identify inter-individual behavioral variations associated with the use of a garbage dump and ii) to examine how these variations influenced ranging patterns, movements behavior and habitat selection.
We identified two remarkably distinct behavioral types: bears that regularly visited the dump and remained sedentary year-round, and bears that never visited the dump and migrated 165.7 ± 20.1 km (round-trip mean cumulative distance ± SE) prior to hibernation to search for food. We demonstrated that during migratory trips, bears moved more rapidly and were less selective in habitat choice than during the sedentary phase; during the migration phase forest cover was the only important environmental characteristic. Our results thus reinforce the growing evidence that animals’ use of the landscape largely changes according to movement phase. Our study shows that anthropogenic food resources can influence food habits, which can have cascading effects on movement patterns and hence habitat selection, ultimately resulting in the establishment of distinct behavioral types within a population. Identification and consideration of these behavioral types is thus fundamental for the correct implementation of evidence-based conservation strategies at the population level.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:124337,0.0039472156204283,0.906674325466156,0.0051661035977303,0.0017437479691579,0.0033697176259011,0.0626887679100036,0.0021994360722601,0.0058083613403141,0.0096538858488202,0.809349775314331,0.1475371718406677,0.7277117967605591,0.0041171330958604,0.1838286519050598,0.9892667531967164,0.0030227308161556,0.0085646286606788,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Quantifying population declines based on presence-only records for red-list assessments
Accurate trend estimates are necessary for understanding which species are declining and which are most in need of conservation action. Imperfect species detection may result in unreliable trend estimates because this may lead to the overestimation of declines. Because many management decisions are based on population trend estimates, such biases could have severe consequences for conservation policy. We used an occupancy-modeling framework to estimate detectability and calculate nationwide population trends for 14 Swiss amphibian species both accounting for and ignoring imperfect detection. Through the application of International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List criteria to the different trend estimates, we assessed whether ignoring imperfect detection could affect conservation policy. Imperfect detection occurred for all species and detection varied substantially among species, which led to the overestimation of population declines when detectability was ignored. Consequently, accounting for imperfect detection lowered the red-list risk category for 5 of the 14 species assessed.

15,"Effects of trophy hunting leftovers on the ranging behaviour of large carnivores: A case study on spotted hyenas
Human-related food resources such as garbage dumps and feeding sites have been shown to significantly influence space use, breeding success and population dynamics in a variety of animal species. In contrast, relatively little is known on the effects of unpredictable sources of food, such as carcasses discarded by hunters, on carnivore species. We evaluated the effect of elephant carcasses, mainly deriving from trophy hunting, on the ranging and feeding behavior of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Using data from hyenas monitored before and during carcass availability via GPS radio-collars and camera traps, we investigated changes in ranging and feeding behavior over time. Carcass availability influenced hyenas’ ranging behavior for an average of 10–12 days, after which their movements returned to patterns observed before carcass availability. In particular, we observed an increased spatial clustering of locations and reduced speeds (up to 15% less) between successive locations with carcass availability. Consistent feeding at carcasses during the first two weeks was typical, and some individuals fed from elephant carcasses for as long as 50 days. The impact and conservation value of hunting are often assessed based solely on the effects on the hunted species. Our results show that hunting remains can influence other species and suggest that such extra food could have important effects on critical life history processes and ultimately population dynamics. We recommend conservationists and wildlife managers evaluate management strategies and hunting practices regarding carcass disposal in order to incorporate the potential collateral impacts of hunting on non-hunted species in the same community.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:117887,0.0039109205827116,0.7802277207374573,0.00665417406708,0.0017053359188139,0.0123138288035988,0.0197966527193784,0.0021665897220373,0.0058324965648353,0.009153195656836,0.026511600241065,0.1914058178663253,0.8159418702125549,0.0040453523397445,0.3740346431732178,0.9803779721260072,0.0029870222788304,0.0090502630919218,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Evolution increases ecosystem temporal stability and recovery from a flood in grassland communities
Understanding factors that increase ecosystem stability is critical in the face of environmental change. Biodiversity plays a key role in buffering ecosystems against disturbances such as extreme climatic events. The evolution of biological communities within their local environment may also increase ecosystem stability and resilience, but this has yet to be tested. Here, we provide evidence for such evolutionary effects using a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment. Communities of plants with a history of co-occurrence (co-selected communities) were temporally more stable at low diversity than the same communities of plants with no such history (naïve communities). Furthermore, co-selected communities exhibited greater recovery following a major flood, resulting in more stable post-flood productivity. These results demonstrate that community evolution can increase ecosystem stability under normal circumstances and in response to extreme disturbance, but also suggest that high diversity can in part compensate for evolutionary naïvety.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:164938,0.0039382623508572,0.1015649661421775,0.0229132287204265,0.0018884437158703,0.0020543662831187,0.7676365375518799,0.0020286224316805,0.8783532381057739,0.0087617523968219,0.0035527064464986,0.6427325010299683,0.1022867336869239,0.8944140076637268,0.1567258834838867,0.9891635179519652,0.0030175277497619,0.0092539340257644,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Mapping functional diversity from remotely sensed morphological and physiological forest traits
Assessing functional diversity from space can help predict productivity and stability of forest ecosystems at global scale using biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships. We present a new spatially continuous method to map regional patterns of tree functional diversity using combined laser scanning and imaging spectroscopy. The method does not require prior taxonomic information and integrates variation in plant functional traits between and within plant species. We compare our method with leaf-level field measurements and species-level plot inventory data and find reasonable agreement. Morphological and physiological diversity show consistent change with topography and soil, with low functional richness at a mountain ridge under specific environmental conditions. Overall, functional richness follows a logarithmic increase with area, whereas divergence and evenness are scale invariant.

15,"Navigating the complexity of ecological stability
Human actions challenge nature in many ways. Ecological responses are ineluctably complex, demanding measures that describe them succinctly. Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall ‘stability’ of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear deﬁnition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientiﬁc and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multi-dimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that deﬁne many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:129396,0.8073703050613403,0.0095255887135863,0.0124448286369442,0.0015166678931564,0.0021969592198729,0.0378164537250995,0.002444326179102,0.0100656393915414,0.1887538284063339,0.0106258038431406,0.0950182303786277,0.4168076813220978,0.0035907316487282,0.63551926612854,0.929960072040558,0.0030060473363846,0.9499840140342712,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Effects of recent environmental change on accuracy of inferences of extinction status
Correctly classifying a species as extinct or extant is of critical importance if current rates of biodiversity loss are to be accurately quantified. Observing an extinction event is rare, so in many cases extinction status is inferred using methods based on the analysis of records of historic sighting events. The accuracy of such methods is difficult to test. However, results of recent experiments with microcosm communities suggest that the rate at which a population declines to extinction, potentially driven by varying environmental conditions, may alter one's ability accurately to infer extinction status. We tested how the rate of population decline, driven by historic environmental change, alters the accuracy of 6 commonly applied sighting-based methods used to infer extinction. We used data from small-scale experimental communities and recorded wild population extirpations. We assessed how accuracy of the different methods was affected by rate of population decline, search effort, and number of sighting events recorded. Rate of population decline and historic population size of the species affected the accuracy of inferred extinction dates; however, faster declines produced more accurate inferred dates of extinction, but only when population sizes were higher. Optimal linear estimation (OLE) offered the most reliable and robust estimates, though no single method performed best in all situations, and it may be appropriate to use a different method if information regarding historic search efforts is available. OLE provided the most accurate estimates of extinction when the number of sighting events used was >10, and future use of this method should take this into account. Data from experimental populations provide added insight into testing techniques to discern wild extirpation events. Care should be taken designing such experiments so that they mirror closely the abundance dynamics of populations affected by real-world extirpation events.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:97395,0.0039225853979587,0.0811300352215766,0.0054224305786192,0.0016241897828876,0.0022542783990502,0.0117604779079556,0.0022451772820204,0.0073468768969178,0.0089641511440277,0.237013429403305,0.7994510531425476,0.1791287064552307,0.0283477585762739,0.3941220045089721,0.9714218974113464,0.0029502259567379,0.0144820790737867,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."

Healthy vegetation function supports diverse biological communities and ecosystem processes, and provides crops, forest products, forage, and countless other benefits. Vegetation function can be assessed by examining dynamic processes and by evaluating plant traits, which themselves are dynamic. Using both trait-based and process-based approaches, spectroscopy can assess vegetation function at multiple scales using a variety of sensors and platforms ranging from proximal to airborne and satellite measurements. Since spectroscopic data are defined by the instruments and platforms available, along with their corresponding spatial, temporal and spectral scales, and since these scales may not always match those of the function of interest, consideration of scale is a necessary focus.

15,"Effect of environmental conditions on sun-induced fluorescence in a mixed forest and a cropland
Due to the large carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, dynamics of photosynthesis can have significant effects on atmospheric CO2 concentrations and lead to large uncertainties in ecosystem C budgets. Remote sensing approaches using sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) hold the potential to directly assess ecosystem photosynthesis. However, many challenges remain linked to using the SIF emission signal to estimate gross primary production (GPP). The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of the relationships between GPP and SIF over different time scales (minutes to years) and under varying environmental conditions. Two different ecosystems were investigated, a cropland and a mixed forest, with continuous eddy covariance flux measurements. Continuous tower-based SIF retrievals were performed in 2015 and 2016 at both ecosystems.

In both ecosystems, SIF was found to be more affected by environmental conditions than GPP. Annual cycles for GPP and SIF differed at the mixed forest due in part to the influence of the different footprint size of the two independent measurements. Diurnal cycles in GPP and SIF corresponded well under unstressed conditions and followed the incoming photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). However, depressions in SIF were found at both sites either at midday or in the afternoon during the growing season. At the cropland site, reductions in SIF occurred at high PPFD (PPFD > 1470 μmol m−2 s−1, R2 = 0.62) and high VPD (VPD > 1590 Pa, R2 = 0.35). Whereas at the forest site, reductions in SIF were linked to high VPD (VPD > 1250 Pa, R2 = 0.25), but not to high PPFD (R2 = 0.84). The depression in SIF was also associated with an increase in non-photochemical quenching, as indicated by the photochemical reflectance index (R2 = 0.78), thus showing the complementarity between SIF and non-photochemical quenching as different energy pathways. Our results show the importance of characterizing the influence of different environmental conditions on SIF-GPP relationships for specific ecosystems to reliably estimate GPP from remote sensing measurements.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:161329,0.0040992517024278,0.8501582741737366,0.0256613045930862,0.0020486766006797,0.002206289442256,0.8148797154426575,0.6905122399330139,0.0060708140954375,0.0092043103650212,0.0035379112232476,0.0270409099757671,0.9322168231010436,0.0041119358502328,0.3909008800983429,0.9678135514259338,0.00314512103796,0.9077175259590148,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Understanding forest health with remote sensing, part III: Requirements for a scalable multi-source forest health monitoring network based on data science approaches
Forest ecosystems fulfill a whole host of ecosystem functions that are essential for life on our planet. However, an unprecedented level of anthropogenic influences is reducing the resilience and stability of our forest ecosystems as well as their ecosystem functions. The relationships between drivers, stress, and ecosystem functions in forest ecosystems are complex, multi-faceted, and often non-linear, and yet forest managers, decision makers, and politicians need to be able to make rapid decisions that are data-driven and based on short and long-term monitoring information, complex modeling, and analysis approaches. A huge number of long-standing and standardized forest health inventory approaches already exist, and are increasingly integrating remote-sensing based monitoring approaches. Unfortunately, these approaches in monitoring, data storage, analysis, prognosis, and assessment still do not satisfy the future requirements of information and digital knowledge processing of the 21st century. Therefore, this paper discusses and presents in detail five sets of requirements, including their relevance, necessity, and the possible solutions that would be necessary for establishing a feasible multi-source forest health monitoring network for the 21st century. Namely, these requirements are: (1) understanding the effects of multiple stressors on forest health; (2) using remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor forest health; (3) coupling different monitoring approaches; (4) using data science as a bridge between complex and multidimensional big forest health (FH) data; and (5) a future multi-source forest health monitoring network. It became apparent that no existing monitoring approach, technique, model, or platform is sufficient on its own to monitor, model, forecast, or assess forest health and its resilience. In order to advance the development of a multi-source forest health monitoring network, we argue that in order to gain a better understanding of forest health in our complex world, it would be conducive to implement the concepts of data science with the components: (i) digitalization; (ii) standardization with metadata management after the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles; (iii) Semantic Web; (iv) proof, trust, and uncertainties; (v) tools for data science analysis; and (vi) easy tools for scientists, data managers, and stakeholders for decision-making support.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157398,0.0043094651773571,0.0060013877227902,0.1543405354022979,0.0017753501888364,0.0022016107104718,0.0240085572004318,0.0019578004721552,0.0076932222582399,0.0109218852594494,0.0033945515751838,0.0432777293026447,0.8916590809822083,0.004224931821227,0.0250523537397384,0.9912604689598083,0.6716936230659485,0.3070543706417084,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Biodiversity–multifunctionality relationships depend on identity and number of measured functions
Biodiversity ensures ecosystem functioning and provisioning of ecosystem services, but it remains unclear how biodiversity–ecosystem multifunctionality relationships depend on the identity and number of functions considered. Here, we demonstrate that ecosystem multifunctionality, based on 82 indicator variables of ecosystem functions in a grassland biodiversity experiment, increases strongly with increasing biodiversity. Analysing subsets of functions showed that the effects of biodiversity on multifunctionality were stronger when more functions were included and that the strength of the biodiversity effects depended on the identity of the functions included. Limits to multifunctionality arose from negative correlations among functions and functions that were not correlated with biodiversity. Our findings underline that the management of ecosystems for the protection of biodiversity cannot be replaced by managing for particular ecosystem functions or services and emphasize the need for specific management to protect biodiversity. More plant species from the experimental pool of 60 species contributed to functioning when more functions were considered. An individual contribution to multifunctionality could be demonstrated for only a fraction of the species.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:151383,0.0041092154569923,0.6574004292488098,0.0125964488834142,0.0015717421192675,0.0021584096830338,0.3169213831424713,0.0020254286937415,0.0084724994376301,0.0115880575031042,0.0245122499763965,0.0732784420251846,0.2466145008802414,0.0037727779708802,0.2892010807991028,0.9901210069656372,0.002747640479356,0.0083869583904743,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Quantifying effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning across times and places
Biodiversity loss decreases ecosystem functioning at the local scales at which species interact, but it remains unclear how biodiversity loss affects ecosystem functioning at the larger scales of space and time that are most relevant to biodiversity conservation and policy. Theory predicts that additional insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning could emerge across time and space if species respond asynchronously to environmental variation and if species become increasingly dominant when and where they are most productive. Even if only a few dominant species maintain ecosystem functioning within a particular time and place, ecosystem functioning may be enhanced by many different species across many times and places (β‐diversity). Here, we develop and apply a new approach to estimate these previously unquantified insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning that arise due to species turnover across times and places. In a long‐term (18‐year) grassland plant diversity experiment, we find that total insurance effects are positive in sign and substantial in magnitude, amounting to 19% of the net biodiversity effect, mostly due to temporal insurance effects. Species loss can therefore reduce ecosystem functioning both locally and by eliminating species that would otherwise enhance ecosystem functioning across temporally fluctuating and spatially heterogeneous environments.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:151382,0.0040796799585223,0.561779797077179,0.0044895396567881,0.0016991816228255,0.0020968106109648,0.1306611597537994,0.0018517298158258,0.9841023087501526,0.0095182182267308,0.0087142419070005,0.1446804702281952,0.3382658362388611,0.0036195784341543,0.1907847821712494,0.9577725529670716,0.0028130956925451,0.2484875619411468,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Soil microbes promote complementarity effects among co-existing trees through soil nitrogen partitioning
Plant resource partitioning is a mechanism promoting species coexistence and ecosystem functioning. Yet, we still have limited understanding of how soil microbes, especially plant symbiotic microbes, influence resource partitioning. We hypothesized that soil‐borne microbes, in particular mycorrhizal fungi, facilitate differential performance of tree species depending on different nitrogen sources and that this leads to a positive plant diversity–community productivity relationship.
    We conducted two complementing glasshouse experiments. In a “monoculture experiment,” we supplied nitrogen as ammonium, nitrate or glycine and tested the growth response of three tree species associated with different root symbionts: one associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi, one associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the third associated with both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and N‐fixing bacteria. In an “intermixed experiment,” we grew the tree species at three richness levels (one, two or three species) in soil supplied with a mix of the three nitrogen forms or no added nitrogen, and with or without soil microbes.
    The monoculture experiment showed that in the presence of soil microbes, the ectomycorrhizal plant species grew best when supplied with glycine and the two arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species grew best with either nitrate or ammonium addition. When the different forms of nitrogen were mixed in the intermixed experiment, plant mixtures produced more biomass than plant monocultures in the presence of soil microbes, with positive complementarity effects indicating microbe‐mediated plant resource partitioning.

Background: The impact of logging and restoration on species diversity has been well studied in tropical forests. However, little is known about their effects on genetic diversity within species.
Aims: We assess the degree of genetic diversity among dipterocarp seedlings used for enrichment planting of selectively logged forests in Sabah, Malaysia, and compare it with diversity in naturally regenerating seedlings.
Methods: We sampled young leaf tissues from seedlings of Shorea leprosula and Parashorea malaanonan for DNA genotyping, using microsatellite markers.
Results: The levels of genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity and rarefied allelic richness) of naturally regenerating seedlings were statistically indistinguishable among unlogged, once logged and repeatedly logged forest areas. Enrichment-planted seedlings of P. malaanonan exhibited similar levels of genetic diversity to naturally regenerating seedlings whereas those of S. leprosula had significantly lower genetic diversity than natural seedlings. Interestingly, reduction of genetic variation was consistently observed in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots among enrichment-planted seedlings.
Conclusions: There was no reduction of genetic variation in naturally regenerating dipterocarp seedlings in areas of selective logging. However, genetic variation of enrichment-planted seedlings was lower in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots. This suggests that enrichment-planting strategies should adopt diverse mixtures that should promote levels of both species richness and genetic diversity within species.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:134672,0.003974687308073,0.8407473564147949,0.0195129308849573,0.0016570361331105,0.0020529630128294,0.0678681954741478,0.0019956545438617,0.0053173350170254,0.0087869502604007,0.011100054718554,0.0408613979816436,0.5468190908432007,0.0041035660542547,0.911327064037323,0.9920863509178162,0.0029204392340034,0.0090700760483741,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Genome assembly and annotation ofArabidopsis halleri, a model for heavy metal hyperaccumulation and evolutionary ecology
The self-incompatible species Arabidopsis halleri is a close relative of the self-compatible model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The broad European and Asian distribution and heavy metal hyperaccumulation ability makes A. halleri a useful model for ecological genomics studies.We used long-insert mate-pair libraries to improve the genome assembly of the A. halleri ssp.gemmifera Tada mine genotype (W302) collected from a site with high contamination by heavy metals in Japan. After five rounds of forced selfing, heterozygosity was reduced to 0.04%, which facilitated subsequent genome assembly. Our assembly now covers 196 Mb or 78% of the estimated genome size and achieved scaffold N50 length of 712 kb. To validate assembly and annotation, we used synteny of A. halleri Tada mine with a previously published high quality reference assembly of a closely related species, Arabidopsis lyrata. Further validation of the assembly quality comes from synteny and phylogenetic analysis of the HEAVY METAL ATPASE4 (HMA4) and METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN1 (MTP1) regions using published sequences from European A. halleri for comparison. Three tandemly duplicated copies of HMA4, key gene involved in cadmium and zinc hyperaccumulation, were assembled on a single scaffold.The assembly will enhance the genome-wide studies of A. halleri as well as the allopolyploid Arabidopsis kamchatica derived from A. lyrata and A. halleri.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:126774,0.0039412095211446,0.1398497521877288,0.0047738538123667,0.0017082779668271,0.0020148081239312,0.5813397169113159,0.0256190486252307,0.0049975658766925,0.0490273497998714,0.0207532476633787,0.0102132568135857,0.4415304958820343,0.0046680220402777,0.4579603374004364,0.7546266317367554,0.0036797113716602,0.008872709237039,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"The population genomic signature of environmental association and gene flow in an ecologically divergent tree species Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae)
Genomewide markers enable us to study genetic differentiation within a species and the factors underlying it at a much higher resolution than before, which advances our understanding of adaptation in organisms. We investigated genomic divergence in Metrosideros polymorpha, a woody species that occupies a wide range of ecological habitats across the Hawaiian Islands and shows remarkable phenotypic variation. Using 1659 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers annotated with the genome assembly, we examined the population genetic structure and demographic history of nine populations across five elevations and two ages of substrates on Mauna Loa, the island of Hawaii. The nine populations were differentiated into two genetic clusters distributed on the lower and higher elevations and were largely admixed on the middle elevation. Demographic modelling revealed that the two genetic clusters have been maintained in the face of gene flow, and the effective population size of the high-altitude cluster was much smaller. A FST -based outlier search among the 1659 SNPs revealed that 34 SNPs (2.05%) were likely to be under divergent selection and the allele frequencies of 21 of them were associated with environmental changes along elevations, such as temperature and precipitation. This study shows a genomic mosaic of M. polymorpha, in which contrasting divergence patterns were found. While most genomic polymorphisms were shared among populations, a small fraction of the genome was significantly differentiated between populations in diverse environments and could be responsible for the dramatic adaptation to a wide range of environments.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:134699,0.0038711188826709,0.1021390557289123,0.0079831900075078,0.0017210330115631,0.0020625472534447,0.8445225358009338,0.0019022523192688,0.0062341443262994,0.0093451831489801,0.0581617951393127,0.1353885978460312,0.1729137897491455,0.0058989403769373,0.9915886521339417,0.2768580615520477,0.0029628132469952,0.0418110117316246,Life on Land,"Aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss."
15,"Dreams of Shanshui: China’s environmental modernization and landscape aesthetics
In the spring of 2015, a series of shanshui landscapes by cartoon artist Feng Zikai decorated official China Dream posters in Shanghai, and could since then be encountered in the streets and subway stations of all major cities. While the dissem- ination of national values and active citizen participation in the government’s envi- ronmental modernization program is clearly the major trajectory, this rapprochement towards a formerly prosecuted artist concomitantly illustrates the current reorientation towards local traditions and cultural continuity in China’s state ideology and propa- ganda work. At the same time, the 2014/15 Shanghai arts scene contributed a number of avant-garde landscape art works that pronounced their creators’ concern about the environmental crisis. It will be argued that there is a subliminal dialogue between Xi Jinping’sproject of landscaping the China Dream and the artists’ selective reclamation of shanshui aesthetics in their ecocritical approaches.

This paper studies cultural representations which critically address the high level of environmental degradation ushered in by successive regimes of China's modernization. On the one hand, it will review a group of blog cartoons reacting to a recent environmental hazard, the Huangpu River floating pigs incident, which were published beginning from mid-March 2013. On the other hand, it looks at intellectual responses to a political economy of short-term profit extraction whose negative impact far exceeds the destruction of the nation's landscapes. Selective readings of lower rungs fiction (diceng wenxue), landscape poetry and multi-media art, and theoretical essays on questions of landscape aesthetics will discuss how these authors express their worries about the consequences of a narrowly functional approach towards natural resources. According to them, the foreclosing of  traditional aesthetic principles that used to support sustainability in modern modes of governance has yielded an unprecedented moral decline of the community as well as an alarming depletion of the nation's non-human recreational powers.

This paper analyzes frontier dynamics of land dispossessions in Ethiopia’s pastoral lowland regions. Through a case study of two sedentarization schemes in South Omo Valley, we illustrate how politics of coercive sedentarization are legitimated in the ‘civilizing’ impetus of ‘improvement schemes’ for ‘backward’ pastoralists. We study sedentarization schemes that are implemented to evict pastoralist communities from grazing land to be appropriated by corporate investors. It is argued that frontier imaginations of pastoral lowlands legitimate coercive practices of ‘emptying’ the lowlands for investments. ‘Improvement schemes’ enroll private investors and enterprises affiliated with Ethiopia’s ruling party in the politics of ‘thickening’ state presence in the pastoral frontier. Agricultural extension packages serve to expand state control over sedentarized pastoralists and make lowland resources more extractable, for investors and for the ruling regime.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157411,0.8307743072509766,0.9796866178512572,0.0192098524421453,0.0017444860422983,0.0169612746685743,0.0024335829075425,0.0022401220630854,0.0620982497930526,0.6923078298568726,0.8653931617736816,0.199671596288681,0.4330526888370514,0.0036135332193225,0.0028394337277859,0.8687190413475037,0.7339902520179749,0.669291615486145,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Making concessions: extractive enclaves, entangled capitalism and regulative pluralism at the gold mining frontier in Burkina Faso
This paper studies the regulation of concessions in the global gold mining rush. The liberalization of the gold mining sector has given way to complex forms of regulation where non-state and illegal mining entrepreneurs compete in governing mining extraction. Taking the case of gold mining in Burkina Faso, this paper analyses the conditions and dynamics under which such complex regulation takes place. We draw on extensive ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Northern Burkina Faso, in particular the Burkinabè mining sector. We argue that enclave economies in the gold mining sector are co-produced by state and market regulation through a ‘‘plurification” of regulatory authority. This ‘‘plurification” is the effect of competition among different frontier entrepreneurs, who seek to broker regulatory authority in mining concession sites. We show that concession sites are not discrete extractive enclaves, but are better understood as indiscrete sites that are entangled in local politics and social relations. Rather than thinning social relations, as is often claimed, we observe that enclave economies thicken politics around concessionary regimes, where governmental bodies re-emerge as an arbitrating regulatory force. These findings problematize policy prescriptions to formalize the gold mining sector and draw attention to the role of the state in re/producing frontier entrepreneurs with unequal political rights to claiming concessions.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157430,0.003797497600317,0.0152598386630415,0.0186371635645627,0.0017785726813599,0.0024744044058024,0.0120832407847046,0.0023152902722358,0.9461357593536376,0.7624149918556213,0.389733076095581,0.0978938862681388,0.3854610919952392,0.0040754447691142,0.0059302314184606,0.0515986904501915,0.8428844213485718,0.7125703692436218,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Beyond citizenship and residence? Exploring the extension of voting rights in the age of globalization
The introductory article to the special issue discusses how the extension of voting rights beyond citizenship (that is, to non-national immigrants) and residence (that is, to expatriates) can be interpreted in the light of democratization processes in both Western countries and in developing regions. It does so by inserting the globalization-specific extension of voting rights to immigrants and expatriates within the long-term series of historical waves of democratization. Does the current extension enhance democracy by granting de facto disenfranchised immigrants and emigrants political rights or does it jeopardize the very functioning of democracy by undermining its legitimacy through the removal of territorial and national boundaries? The article offers a synthesis of the findings of the volume's contributions in a broad comparative perspective covering both alien and external voting rights in Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. It shows that reforms toward more expansive electorates vary considerably and that their effects on the inclusion of migrants largely depend on the specific regulations and the socio-political context in which they operate.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:114929,0.0035696374252438,0.1006588488817215,0.0166059918701648,0.0226501505821943,0.0529643483459949,0.0018765374552458,0.0021746472921222,0.4838998317718506,0.3817861080169678,0.9950073957443236,0.0504235886037349,0.0038955421186983,0.0035380644258111,0.0168722756206989,0.0065970513969659,0.9962932467460632,0.860104501247406,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."

16,"Values, attitudes toward interpersonal violence, and interpersonal violent behavior
The relevance of human values for the study of the motivational sources of interpersonal violent behavior was investigated in various fields of the social sciences. However, several past studies mixed up values with other dimensions like attitudes, norms, or beliefs, and only a few systematically assessed the effect of values on violent behavior relying on a value theory. Furthermore, in other studies, violence was often analyzed as a composite index of different forms of delinquent behavior rather than as violence per se. In the current study we address these gaps in the literature by building upon Schwartz’ theory of basic human values. We use it to explain attitudes toward interpersonal violence and interpersonal violent behavior. We analyze data of young people (n = 1,810) drawn from a German study in Duisburg, Germany, which assessed various types of self-reported violent behavior as well as values and attitudes toward violence. We test structural equation models in which we explain interpersonal violent behavior with basic human values, and where attitudes toward interpersonal violent behavior mediate this relation. Results show that self-transcendence and conservation values are associated negatively and power and stimulation values positively with interpersonal violent behavior. In addition, attitudes operate as a partial mediator for the former and as a full mediator for the latter in the relation between values and violent behavior. Despite a dominant association between attitudes and behavior, values themselves can significantly contribute to the explanation of violent behavior.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:158678,0.0038344722706824,0.0535407103598117,0.0190709233283996,0.0331684723496437,0.9926015734672546,0.0021391473710536,0.0022708617616444,0.0840049907565116,0.009077064692974,0.265802800655365,0.7467299699783325,0.0044777207076549,0.0038069204892963,0.0043670632876455,0.8634198307991028,0.9719589948654176,0.0240715350955724,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Developmental predictors of violent extremist attitudes: A test of general strain theory among a sample of Swiss youth
Objectives: This study examines the influence of collective strain on support
for violent extremism among an ethnically diverse sample of Swiss adolescents.
This study explores two claims derived from general strain theory:
(1) Exposure to collective strain is associated with higher support for violent
extremism and (2) the effect of collective strain is conditional on
perceptions of moral and legal constraints. Methods: This study uses data
from two waves of the Zurich Project on the Social Development of Children
and Youth. We use ordinary least squares procedures to regress
violent extremist attitudes at age 17 on strain, moral and legal constraints,
and control variables measured at ages 15 to 17. Conditional effects were
examined using an interaction term for collective strain and moral neutralization
and legal cynicism, respectively. Results: The results show that collective
strain does not have a direct effect on violent extremist attitudes
once other variables are controlled. However, the degree to which individuals
neutralize moral and legal constraints amplifies the impact of collective
strain on violent extremist attitudes. Conclusions: This study shows that
those who already espouse justifications for violence and rule breaking are
more vulnerable to extremist violent pathways, particularly when exposed
to collective social strife, conflict, and repression.

We will focus on advanced postindustrial democracies and six concerns that are all closely linked to the dissemination and acquisition of political knowledge: (1) declining supply of political information, (2) declining quality of news, (3) increasing media concentration and declining diversity of news, (4) increasing fragmentation and polarization, (5) increasing relativism and (6) increasing inequality in political knowledge.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:149430,0.3818795382976532,0.0090279802680015,0.0155864935368299,0.5242983102798462,0.0031195692718029,0.0019169251900166,0.0021594923455268,0.8765113353729248,0.1461883038282394,0.9873713254928588,0.1238967701792717,0.0042056748643517,0.0036046544555574,0.002490299521014,0.688180685043335,0.9681318402290344,0.0950255766510963,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"At war with the unknown: Hollywood, Homeland Security, and the cultural imaginary of terrorism after 9/11
Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Bush administration established a security discourse based on the paradigm of ""uncertain threats,"" characterizing the ""war on terror"" as a war against the ""unknown."" From the point of view of this new security discourse, counterterrorism should not confine itself to the accumulation of data concerning the goals, strategies, and means of terrorist networks. It also depends on ingenuity on the part of security analysts in the imagination of possible present and future events. Besides analyzing facts, counterterrorism has to work speculatively through possibilities, to think in the subjunctive. Consequently, members of the Hollywood entertainment industry were invited by the Pentagon in October 2001 ""to brainstorm about possible terrorist targets and schemes in America and to offer solutions to those threats."" The present article argues that the consideration of fiction as potential fact is symptomatic of the discursive response to terror, which oscillates between the real (actual incidents of political violence) and the imaginary (anticipated further attacks), both drawing on and contributing to what I propose to conceptualize as the cultural imaginary of terrorism. Although this dynamic became particularly salient after 9/11, it has a much longer history, going back to the first emergence of sub-state violence against public targets at the close of the nineteenth century, when several literary writers devised spectacular scenarios of attacks from the air or with biological weapons. What distinguishes these late-Victorian fictions from post-9/11 counterterrorist discourse, however, is that the latter has made the imaginary an integral feature of homeland defense and thus a basis for political practice.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167623,0.0039540943689644,0.0879440233111381,0.1066394820809364,0.1198855713009834,0.2878027558326721,0.0036769940052181,0.0020761408377438,0.0808326974511146,0.7789340019226074,0.1505496948957443,0.301553338766098,0.0087141469120979,0.7003176808357239,0.0063381497748196,0.0163075178861618,0.996193528175354,0.1124257892370224,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Nothing to hide, nothing to lose? Incentives and disincentives to sharing information with institutions online
What incentives and disincentives do Internet users weigh as they consider providing information to institutional actors such as government agencies and corporations online? Focus group participants list several benefits to sharing information including convenience, access to information, personalization, financial incentives, and more accurate health information, but also recognize that not all sharing may be in their interest. Disincentives to sharing include skepticism, distrust, and fears of discrimination. Decisions about sharing are related to the information type, the context in which information is revealed, and the institution to which they are – or think they are – providing information. Significantly, many participants were mistrustful of both governmental and corporate actors. Participants displayed awareness of privacy risks, but frequently mischaracterized the extent to which information could be aggregated and mined. They displayed resignation towards privacy violations, suggesting that they perceived little control over their ability to protect their privacy, which may influence their privacy behaviors. This calls into question the privacy calculus, as individuals misunderstand the risks of their information provision and do not believe opting out of information-sharing is possible.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168027,0.0037366126198321,0.0615730807185173,0.6646618843078613,0.0789906084537506,0.0278596393764019,0.0020282054319977,0.0025656656362116,0.4188679456710815,0.546501636505127,0.9849629998207092,0.0282285790890455,0.0045054168440401,0.0060752443969249,0.0058414284139871,0.0072310385294258,0.9951221346855164,0.150935485959053,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Sex differences in intrusive memories following trauma
BACKGROUND: A key mechanism thought to underlie Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is enhanced emotional memory consolidation. Recent evidence in healthy controls revealed that women have greater negative memory consolidation following stress relative to men. This study examined emotional memory consolidation in women and men with PTSD, and in trauma-exposed and non-trauma controls to test the hypothesis that emotionally negative memory consolidation would be greater in women with PTSD.

METHOD: One hundred and forty-seven men and women (47 with PTSD, 49 trauma-exposed controls, and 51 non-trauma controls) completed an emotional memory task where they looked at negative, neutral and positive images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Delayed recall and an intrusive memory diary were completed two days later.

RESULTS: Women displayed greater recall, and reported more negative intrusive memories than men. A gender x group interaction effect showed that both women with PTSD and trauma-exposed women reported more intrusive memories than women without trauma exposure or men.

CONCLUSION: This study provided preliminary evidence of sex differences in intrusive memories in those with PTSD as well as those with a history of trauma exposure. Future research should include measures of sex hormones to further examine sex differences on memory consolidation in the context of trauma exposure and PTSD.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168830,0.0038563474081456,0.0137018440291285,0.9836205244064332,0.049061145633459,0.994838535785675,0.0018278829520568,0.0021782231051474,0.0391180776059627,0.0088724410161376,0.0944819226861,0.0218058489263057,0.0066681699827313,0.0048204874619841,0.0022970987483859,0.0080021079629659,0.5477762818336487,0.0464196875691413,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Mental Defeat and Cumulative Trauma Experiences Predict Trauma-Related Psychopathology: Evidence From a Postconflict Population in Northern Uganda
The peritraumatic cognitive process of mental defeat, the complete loss of inner resistance, has been identified as a key predictor of PTSD. Yet, most evidence on cognitive risk factors stems from industrialized countries where survivors typically report few traumata. Research from postconflict settings indicates that individual differences decrease with accumulating traumatic experiences, as almost everybody develops PTSD at extreme levels of trauma load. Would this leave less room for the impact of cognitive processes? In a sample of 227 Ugandan rebel war survivors, we investigated whether mental defeat influences trauma-related psychopathology in regression models accounting for cumulative trauma exposure. We found strong main effects of mental defeat on lifetime PTSD risk, current PTSD severity and dissociative symptoms, but no mental defeat × trauma load interaction effects. Our results indicate that peritraumatic mental defeat is central to understand individual differences in psychological reactions after single traumatic events as well as multiple traumatization.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:149185,0.0037916719447821,0.0089791510254144,0.6829915046691895,0.0754000321030616,0.9425317645072936,0.0020168386399745,0.0021502992603927,0.1170869469642639,0.8192647099494934,0.2273143082857132,0.4101060926914215,0.0063400543294847,0.0048367376439273,0.0035816158633679,0.0071785771287977,0.8901110887527466,0.0887390077114105,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Predictors of remission from PTSD symptoms after sexual and non-sexual trauma in the community: A mediated survival-analytic approach
Epidemiological data on the chronicity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in relation to trauma type and underlying pathways are rare. The current study explored how PTSD symptoms change over time across different trauma types and examined mediators of their persistence. A trauma-exposed community sample, whereof approximately one quarter met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, provided retrospective data on the duration of PTSD symptoms. Those who remitted and those who had not at the time of assessment were compared regarding worst trauma, symptom severity, comorbidity, demographic and treatment-seeking variables. Time to remission was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models including candidate predictors of remission. A mediated survival analysis was used to explore indirect pathways that explain trauma-specific differences in remission times. Both the full sample and PTSD subgroup were analyzed separately. Overall, lower socio-economic status, lifetime and childhood sexual trauma, symptom severity, comorbid depression and past treatment were associated with non- and longer remissions. PTSD avoidance symptoms and comorbid depression were found to mediate longer remission times after lifetime or childhood sexual trauma.

16,"Patterns of Adverse Childhood Experiences in Juveniles Who Sexually Offended
Juveniles who sexually offended (JSOs) are differentially burdened with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The present study used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to derive subtypes of JSOs according to their patterns of 10 different ACEs. An extensive file analysis of 322 male JSOs ( M = 14.14, SD = 1.94) revealed five subtypes with (a) multiple (9.0%), (b) mainly family related (17.1%), (c) mainly peer related (21.7%), (d) mainly neglectful (18.6%), and (e) little/no (33.5%) ACEs. Differences among ACE subtypes with regard to several offense and victim characteristics (e.g., the use of penetration or violence, the choice of a child, a male, a stranger, or multiple victims) were examined. Whereas no differences were found for the use of physical violence or the choice of male, stranger, or multiple victims, binary logistic regressions revealed associations of the multiple-ACE subtype with the choice of a child victim, the family-ACE subtype with the use of penetration as well as further nonsexual delinquency, the peer-ACE subtype with the use of penetration and the choice of a child victim, and the neglect-subtype with the choice of a child victim. Additional analyses including single ACE categories instead of LCA-derived subtypes supported these results.

Depression and other psychic disorders are a common side effect of military missions abroad. A relatively new field of research investigates personal value orientations and moral injuries and inquires into the role they play in the onset of psycholo­gical problems following involvement in military operations.
In the present study, German Bundeswehr soldiers were tested psychometrically before and immediately after a mission in Afghanistan for value orientations, moral injuries, posttraumatic symptoms and depression. They were compared with a control group that had not undergone a military assignment abroad.
Value awareness (value index) changed significantly less in the task force than in the control group. Both this value index and the values «conformity« and «tradition« were significantly associated with the onset of depression in the task force.

16,"Differential Associations Among PTSD and Complex PTSD Symptoms and Traumatic Experiences and Postmigration Difficulties in a Culturally Diverse Refugee Sample
Forced migration is one of the major challenges currently facing the international community. Many refugees have been affected by traumatic experiences at home and during their flight, putting them at a heightened risk of developing trauma-related disorders. The new version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) introduced two sibling disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD). So far, little is known about risk and protective factors in refugees that are specifically associated with the disturbances in self-organization (DSO) characteristic of CPTSD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between PTSD and DSO symptoms and traumatic experiences, postmigration difficulties, and social support in a culturally diverse sample of refugees who resettled in Switzerland. A total of 94 refugees (85.1% male; M age = 31.60 years, SD = 10.14, range: 18-61 years) participated in this study. Trained assessors performed either guided questionnaire assessments or structured interviews. In our advice- and help-seeking sample, 32.9% of individuals suffered from PTSD and 21.3% from CPTSD. After controlling for potential gender differences, we found positive associations between PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure, β = .22, as well as between DSO symptoms and postmigration living difficulties, β = .42, and lack of social support, β = .22. Our findings support the notion that it is highly important to consider differential associations among PTSD and DSO symptoms and risk and protective factors to gain a deeper understanding of the trauma-related problems refugees face.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:158263,0.0211877543479204,0.0092358440160751,0.548542857170105,0.2689760327339172,0.9896134734153748,0.0029725823551416,0.0022042884957045,0.7941485643386841,0.0093312431126832,0.980761468410492,0.0763467624783515,0.0057877735234797,0.0045976787805557,0.0025101737119257,0.0065633687190711,0.8477711081504822,0.8770409226417542,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Stronger inspection incentives, less crime? Further experimental evidence on inspection games
When do more severe punishments not deter crimes and when are stronger incentives for control personnel ineffective to motive control? This contribution shows when incentives for crime control have paradoxical effects. It follows from game theoretical reasoning that the opposed interests between criminals and inspectors lead to strategies, where both seek to outsmart each other. If both do so, ego's incentives only affect alter's behavior. This ""strategic incentive effect"" implies that higher punishments do not cause less crimes, but less inspections. This was experimentally corroborated by Rauhut (2009). The second implication is that stronger inspection incentives do not cause more inspections, but less crimes. This paper studies the second implication under farsighted strategic actors, shows its robustness by agent-based simulations of backward-looking learning and provides experimental evidence. In the laboratory experiment, 200 subjects were partitioned into ""citizens"" who could steal money from each other and ""inspectors"" who could invest in inspection to detect criminal citizens. Results confirm that stronger inspection incentives cause less crime. However, actors are less strategic than predicted: stronger inspection incentives also cause more inspections. This is discussed by differentiating between the ""strategic incentive-effect"", where ego's incentives only affect alter's behavior and the ""own incentive-effect"", where ego's incentives also affect ego's behavior. Conclusions discuss alternative models of rationality and heuristics and how the presented findings may be used for constructing novel theories on crime and social norms. Also policy implications are discussed.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:95931,0.0474757775664329,0.0419642589986324,0.0125716356560587,0.1122816428542137,0.065611720085144,0.0047320239245891,0.0032662679441273,0.3789319097995758,0.1146999076008796,0.3431068360805511,0.0448826104402542,0.004025962203741,0.0355689898133277,0.0061216005124151,0.0085295224562287,0.9958884119987488,0.1012086644768714,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Avoiding detection or reciprocating norm violations? An experimental comparison of self- and other-regarding mechanisms for norm adherence
There is a growing body of research showing that people altruistically enforce cooperation norms in social dilemmas. Most of this research analyzes situations where norm violators are known and group members enforce cooperation among each other. However, in many situations norm violators are unknown and detection and punishment is enforced by third parties, such as in plagiarism, tax evasion, doping or even two-timing. Our contribution is threefold. Conceptually, we show the usefulness of inspection game experiments for studying normative behavior in these situations. Methodologically, we present a novel measurement of strategic norm adherence and enforcement, asking for continuous, ""frequentistic"" choice probabilities. Substantively, we demonstrate that norm adherence in these situations is best understood by coexisting distinct actor types. Self-regarding types learn the inspection rate and calibrate their norm violations to maximize own payoffs. Other-regarding types reciprocate experienced victimizations by stealing from other, unknown group members; even at additional costs. We specify both mechanisms by agent-based simulation models and compare their relative strength by behavioral and attitudinal data in inspection game experiments (N=220). Our results suggest a modern sociological perspective, which combines homo oeconomicus with homo sociologicus. Further, our findings contribute to understanding conditional norm compliance in ""broken windows"" dynamics, since we show under controlled conditions that it may result jointly from self- and other regarding mechanisms.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:95628,0.2651219964027405,0.0060745561495423,0.3683246076107025,0.0636506825685501,0.1701247841119766,0.0020983167923986,0.0025101543869823,0.5527728796005249,0.5424554347991943,0.6929590702056885,0.0361780487000942,0.0038678052369505,0.0039836205542087,0.0043098046444356,0.0060812644660472,0.995755672454834,0.9878464341163636,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."

The paper deals with the question of how moral philosophy could serve public interest. It accepts the view that moral philosophy does serve public interest. However, it rejects the reasons that are typically provided for such a position. It rejects the claim that the beneficial role of moral philosophy is due to moral philosophers’ expertise which allows them to provide the public with the right answers to moral questions. Instead, it holds that the benefits are to be found elsewhere. Moral experts, the paper argues, differ from experts on non-normative issues. One should not act on the judgements of moral philosophers. This is not because moral philosophers are unlikely to get it right in moral matters, but because one only has reasons to follow their judgements if one has a moral understanding of the practical issues in question.

Do these needs translate into specific goals in social interactions? In the present research, we examined the hypotheses that (1) experiencing one’s ingroup as illegitimately disadvantaged or victimized arouses agentic goals (to act and appear assertive and confident) when interacting with the advantaged or victimizing group, while (2) experiencing one’s ingroup as illegitimately advantaged or perpetrating transgressions arouses communal goals (to act and appear warm and trustworthy) when interacting with the disadvantaged or victimized group. Study 1 (N = 391) generally supported both hypotheses across diverse intergroup contexts involving gender, national/ethnic, and consumer identities. Study 2 (N = 122) replicated this pattern in a context of occupational identities. Study 2 further showed that the effect of ingroup role on agentic and communal intergroup goals was not moderated by participants’ general dispositional preferences for agentic and communal goals in interpersonal interactions, thus demonstrating how ingroup role exerts a distinct and robust influence on goals for interactions with other groups. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170746,0.0224494971334934,0.0546584390103817,0.0115319108590483,0.0679995641112327,0.9953403472900392,0.0021021352149546,0.0021773765329271,0.7152618169784546,0.020348135381937,0.9944394826889038,0.0236269980669021,0.007250792812556,0.0037210739683359,0.0050626592710614,0.0064924173057079,0.996057152748108,0.0513052977621555,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Agents of Prosociality: Agency Affirmation Promotes Mutual Prosocial Tendencies and Behavior Among Conflicting Groups
Members of conflicting groups are motivated to restore their ingroup's agency, leading to antisocial tendencies against the outgroup. The present research tested the hypothesis that affirming conflicting groups' agency would increase their members' mutual prosociality. The effectiveness of agency affirmation was demonstrated in three contexts of conflict between groups: Switzerland and the EU following the 2014 referendum (Study 1), Israelis and Palestinians (Study 2), and Israeli rightists and leftists (Study 3). Study 1 found that in a nonconflictual context Swiss participants prioritized their moral (prosocial) over agentic goals, yet in the context of conflict with the EU, they prioritized their agentic over moral goals. This “primacy-of-agency” effect, however, was eliminated once their ingroup's agency was affirmed. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated the positive effect of agency affirmation on prosociality among Israelis referring to Palestinians and Israeli rightists and leftists referring to the adversarial political camp. This effect was mediated by group members' readiness to relinquish some power for the sake of morality. Pointing to the importance of the affirmation's specific content, Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that morality affirmation failed to increase prosociality. As such, the present research puts forward a promising strategy to reduce hostility and promote prosociality between conflicting groups.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:136480,0.220236137509346,0.0377994775772094,0.0374876670539379,0.0768488273024559,0.0839633196592331,0.001889853272587,0.0022474119905382,0.6783691048622131,0.2963462173938751,0.9939513206481934,0.0298187676817178,0.0037386456970125,0.0137121072039008,0.0032925708219408,0.0080136312171816,0.9952978491783142,0.3506991863250732,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Exclusion from public space: A comparative constitutional analysis
Hardly known twenty years ago, exclusion from public space has today become a standard tool of state intervention. Every year, tens of thousands of homeless individuals, drug addicts, teenagers, protesters and others are banned from parts of public space. The rise of exclusion measures is characteristic of two broader developments that have profoundly transformed public space in recent years: the privatisation of public space, and its increased control in the 'security society'. Despite the fundamental problems it raises, exclusion from public space has received hardly any attention from legal scholars. This book addresses this gap and comprehensively explores the implications that this new form of intervention has for the constitutional essentials of liberal democracy: the rule of law, fundamental rights, and democracy. To do so, it analyses legal developments in three liberal democracies that have been at the forefront of promoting exclusion measures: the United Kingdom, the United States, and Switzerland.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:128776,0.0037617397028952,0.010603254660964,0.8914891481399536,0.008803516626358,0.2274585664272308,0.0018894243985414,0.0022918831091374,0.0992386788129806,0.0092177055776119,0.9954417943954468,0.9338867664337158,0.0047363783232867,0.0038797468878328,0.0023184106685221,0.0062154135666787,0.9955278038978576,0.1813179105520248,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"The cognitive foundations of cooperation
Why do some individuals cooperate with their fellow human beings while others take advantage of them? The human drive for cooperation and altruism is one of the most powerful forces shaping our society, but there is an enormous behavioral variance in individual behavior. At the same time, whether it is intuitive to behave in a cooperative manner or whether such behaviors are calculated deeds remains an unanswered question. Indeed, recent empirical investigations regarding the spontaneity of human cooperation have found mixed evidence, possibly due to a failure to induce compliance in the behavioral manipulations employed. We conducted a laboratory experiment inducing intuitive and deliberative behavior through gradual economic incentives that ensure compliance. To account for individual heterogeneity, we independently measured social value orientation and aversion to interpersonal (strategic) uncertainty. We find that these measures determine the intrinsic predisposition towards cooperation. Subjects with more altruistic social values or a higher tolerance towards interpersonal uncertainty are more cooperative. Crucially, we find causal evidence that there is no universal default mode of behavior. Rather, intuition enhances intrinsic predispositions, while deliberation moderates them towards socially acceptable behavior. That is, subjects with a higher (resp. lower) predisposition towards cooperation became more (resp. less) cooperative under time pressure compared with time delay.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157219,0.0041670380160212,0.0100808320567011,0.0204994101077318,0.023882633075118,0.9070879817008972,0.0023056527134031,0.0024491001386195,0.16450896859169,0.3552135527133941,0.9919135570526124,0.0206816401332616,0.0047220722772181,0.0034634051844477,0.0026343488134443,0.0054446482099592,0.94685959815979,0.9892095923423768,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Raising money for the state: challenges of taxation in developing countries
No state can exist in the long term without effective taxation. To be able to execute its various roles, the state needs to acquire the capacity to enforce compliance with tax obligations. In developing countries, this task is far from obvious. Taxation is particularly challenging in less formalized economies, since it is difficult for the government to gain information about what taxable transactions actually occurred. One important source of information that governments rely on are paper trails by third parties, which document such transactions. This talk presents evidence from Chile and Ecuador on the power and limitations of such paper trails. It also discusses the challenges that can emerge as countries introduce the use of third-party reported information for tax enforcement. The evidence suggests that despite the (helpful) growth of computer-based monitoring using cross-checks of third-party information, strengthening the traditional enforcement capacity of developing country governments still remains crucial for effective tax collection.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:153012,0.0062774596735835,0.0293984096497297,0.0201934073120355,0.0203987229615449,0.0035570748150348,0.0026322884950786,0.0075388490222394,0.3046801090240478,0.9088723063468932,0.5834549069404602,0.0577492825686931,0.0066624456085264,0.0179369132965803,0.0040306011214852,0.0223436318337917,0.9965003728866576,0.9886878132820128,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
16,"Do leaders affect ethical conduct?
We study whether leaders influence the unethical conduct of followers. To avoid selection issues present in natural environments, we use an experiment in which we create simple laboratory firms and assign leadership roles at random. In our first experiment, firms engage in competition and unethical behavior enhances firm earnings but produces a negative externality for all firms. We vary, by treatment, two instruments through which leaders can influence follower conduct—prominent statements to the group and the allocation of monetary incentives. We find that leaders influence the ethical conduct of followers both through their statements and through the use of incentives. Moreover, leaders who are likely to have acted dishonestly in a preliminary stage of the experiment are more likely to employ mechanisms to encourage dishonesty among followers. As a result, firms randomly assigned one of these unethical leaders are more likely to engage in misreporting. A second experiment finds that the above relationships are present, though weaker, when firms do not engage in direct competition.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:147177,0.0342337228357791,0.0103647429496049,0.0144002120941877,0.0355318933725357,0.03329823538661,0.0021937566343694,0.0030171244870871,0.918299674987793,0.977469265460968,0.8934239745140076,0.0178516395390033,0.9372576475143432,0.0043595661409199,0.0023528209421783,0.5609137415885925,0.9782166481018066,0.4401650726795196,Peace and Justice Strong Institutions,"Aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."
17,"Resourcing international organisations: so what?
The changes observed in resourcing international organisations over the last decades may have dramatic consequences for their ability to fulfil their mandates. This paper investigates into how far reaching the expected changes really are, and whether the new types and sources of financial and human resources can really be considered as causal for these developments. It appears that resourcing may not be the initial cause, but contributes to the centrifugal dynamics currently observed in the multilateral system. Administrative cost related to the new and complex funding structures are considerable, and ensuring transparency over resource flows represents a major challenge. Official decision-making bodies lose power to sub-groups of members or external actors that fund parts of the organisations’ activities through separate channels. Given the large volume of non-core funding and the lack of transparency, they cannot easily adjust their own priorities. It can thus not be expected that the funding of certain activities through external channels will simply be compensated by a corresponding reduction of core funding in this area. Whether this negatively affects the ability of the organisations to fulfil their mandates – and hence, eventually their legitimacy – depends on the motivations of those actors empowered in this process.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:144205,0.0037296449299901,0.0312631540000438,0.0213934015482664,0.0079383617267012,0.0044579072855412,0.0017940156394615,0.003555440576747,0.9505457282066344,0.7137438058853149,0.5608481764793396,0.1342773139476776,0.8130007982254028,0.0034384615719318,0.0046663517132401,0.0049866568297147,0.9942216277122498,0.9879487752914428,Partnerships for the Goals,Aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.

Analyzing international negotiations among the member states of the European Union raises a number of analytical issues, especially in unusual circumstances such as the Eurozone crisis. Our article discusses these issues in the light of existing theory and informed by the empirical analyses assembled in this special issue. ‘National preferences’ or ideal points of the governments involved are driven by their domestic socio-economic and political conditions and institutions, the dimensionality of the negotiations, and strategic considerations. We then discuss how national preferences, states’ bargaining power, the strategic and institutional bargaining context, and the bargaining dynamics jointly influence the bargaining outcome.

17,"Noncooperation by popular vote: expectations, foreign intervention, and the vote in the 2015 Greek bailout referendum
When popular referendums fail to ratify new international agreements or succeed in reversing existing ones, it not only affects domestic voters but also creates negative spillovers for the other parties to such agreements. We explore how voters respond to this strategic environment. We use original survey data from a poll fielded just one day before the 2015 Greek bailout referendum—a referendum in which the stakes for other countries were particularly high—to investigate how expectations about the likely foreign response to a noncooperative referendum outcome influence voting behavior and to what extent foreign policymakers can influence those expectations. Our analysis of the Greek referendum shows that such expectations had a powerful effect on voting behavior: voters expecting that a noncooperative referendum outcome would force Greece to leave the eurozone were substantially more likely to vote cooperatively than those believing that it would result in renewed negotiations with the country's creditors. Leveraging the bank closure that took place right before the vote, we also show that costly signals by foreign actors made voters more pessimistic about the consequences of a noncooperative vote and substantially increased the share of cooperative votes.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:159516,0.0036903605796396,0.0193803887814283,0.0082689626142382,0.0149476677179336,0.0045935562811791,0.0017278492450714,0.0019413168774917,0.52978515625,0.2729287147521972,0.7212433218955994,0.0371516495943069,0.005002514924854,0.7881656885147095,0.0038569828029721,0.6122917532920837,0.9959112405776978,0.9718796610832214,Partnerships for the Goals,Aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.
17,"The mass politics of international disintegration
In the past few years, the world has witnessed an unprecedented popular backlash against international institutions. Popular demands to not only slow down, but to reverse international integration have proliferated, and have resulted in referendum and election outcomes that have reverberated across the world. Examples range from the Swiss 2014 mass immigration initiative over the British 2016 Brexit referendum to the 2016 election of a US President seemingly determined to withdraw US support from various international treaties. The implications of these mass-based disintegration efforts reach far beyond the countries in which they originate. First, the disintegration process is shaped by how remaining member states respond to one member’s bid to unilaterally change or terminate the terms of an existing international agreement. Second, mass-based disintegration bids also pose considerable risks of political contagion by encouraging disintegrative tendencies in other countries. Yet despite their disruptive nature, very little research exists beyond individual case studies on the general drivers, dynamics and challenges these instances of mass-based disintegration pose for international cooperation. This paper therefore engages in a comparative inquiry into the mass politics of disintegration that pays particular attention to the strategic dilemmas these instances pose for the affected international institutions and their remaining member states. It argues that the remaining member states have incentives to intervene in domestic campaigns in which disintegration figures as a viable outcome, but that the difficulties of successful intervention are considerable. It also shows that after a vote in favor of disintegration, the remaining member states face an “accommodation dilemma” between preserving as many cooperation gains as possible and making exit costly in order to discourage other member states from following suit.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:161795,0.0037579692434519,0.0483979508280754,0.0096229212358593,0.0072860694490373,0.0154986251145601,0.0020551874767988,0.0023101952392607,0.2850423455238342,0.646211564540863,0.9935411214828492,0.0618673674762249,0.0038853825535625,0.0035945195704698,0.0038998168893158,0.0069347717799246,0.9959787130355836,0.9838387966156006,Partnerships for the Goals,Aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.
17,"Globalization and the demand-side of politics: how globalization shapes labor market risk perceptions and policy preferences
Does globalization affect the demand-side of politics, and if so, how? This paper builds on new developments in trade theory to argue that globalization matters, but that its effects on individuals’ perceptions of labor market risk and policy preferences are more heterogenous than previous research has acknowledged. Globalization exposure increases risk perceptions and demands for social protection among low-skilled individuals, but decreases them among high-skilled individuals. This conditional effect is observationally distinct from classic trade models as well as arguments that deindustrialization or ideology predominantly drive such perceptions and preferences. Analyzing cross-national survey data from 16 European countries and focusing both on trade and offshoring, the empirical analyses support the prediction that exposure to globalization affects high- and low-skilled individuals differently, leading to variation in labor market risk perceptions and policy preferences.",oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:130330,0.0036095522809773,0.1131982281804084,0.0078837415203452,0.5651643872261047,0.0035197504330426,0.0025066768284887,0.0020907439757138,0.9911837577819824,0.5830661058425903,0.9768757820129396,0.046607170253992,0.003982650116086,0.5634374022483826,0.0036815209314227,0.0063907578587532,0.5214824080467224,0.9233635067939758,Partnerships for the Goals,Aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.
