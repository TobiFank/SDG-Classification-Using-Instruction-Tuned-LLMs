Accurate trend estimates are necessary for understanding which species are declining and which are most in need of conservation action. Imperfect species detection may result in unreliable trend estimates because this may lead to the overestimation of declines. Because many management decisions are based on population trend estimates, such biases could have severe consequences for conservation policy. We used an occupancy-modeling framework to estimate detectability and calculate nationwide population trends for 14 Swiss amphibian species both accounting for and ignoring imperfect detection. Through the application of International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List criteria to the different trend estimates, we assessed whether ignoring imperfect detection could affect conservation policy. Imperfect detection occurred for all species and detection varied substantially among species, which led to the overestimation of population declines when detectability was ignored. Consequently, accounting for imperfect detection lowered the red-list risk category for 5 of the 14 species assessed. We demonstrate that failing to consider species detectability can have serious consequences for species management and that occupancy modeling provides a flexible framework to account for observation bias and improve assessments of conservation status. A problem inherent to most historical records is that they contain presence-only data from which only relative declines can be estimated. A move toward the routine recording of nonobservation and absence data is essential if conservation practitioners are to move beyond this toward accurate population trend estimation.",15,"
The abstract discusses the importance of accurate population trend estimates for determining which species require conservation action. It highlights the issue of imperfect species detection, which can lead to unreliable trend estimates and severe consequences for conservation policy. The study uses an occupancy-modeling framework to estimate detectability and calculate population trends for 14 Swiss amphibian species, accounting for and ignoring imperfect detection. The analysis shows that detection varied significantly among species and that ignoring detectability led to the overestimation of population declines. As a result, accounting for imperfect detection lowered the red-list risk category for five species assessed. The study emphasizes the importance of considering species detectability to improve assessments of conservation status and highlights the need for the routine recording of nonobservation and absence data to estimate accurate population trends.","

Why do some individuals cooperate with their fellow human beings while others take advantage of them? The human drive for cooperation and altruism is one of the most powerful forces shaping our society, but there is an enormous behavioral variance in individual behavior. At the same time, whether it is intuitive to behave in a cooperative manner or whether such behaviors are calculated deeds remains an unanswered question. Indeed, recent empirical investigations regarding the spontaneity of human cooperation have found mixed evidence, possibly due to a failure to induce compliance in the behavioral manipulations employed. We conducted a laboratory experiment inducing intuitive and deliberative behavior through gradual economic incentives that ensure compliance. To account for individual heterogeneity, we independently measured social value orientation and aversion to interpersonal (strategic) uncertainty. We find that these measures determine the intrinsic predisposition towards cooperation. Subjects with more altruistic social values or a higher tolerance towards interpersonal uncertainty are more cooperative. Crucially, we find causal evidence that there is no universal default mode of behavior. Rather, intuition enhances intrinsic predispositions, while deliberation moderates them towards socially acceptable behavior. That is, subjects with a higher (resp. lower) predisposition towards cooperation became more (resp. less) cooperative under time pressure compared with time delay.",16,"
The abstract explores the cognitive foundations of cooperation and the factors that influence individual behavior. The study addresses the variance in cooperation and whether it is innate or calculated, finding mixed results in previous research due to a lack of compliance in behavioral manipulations. The experiment induces intuitive and deliberative behavior through economic incentives, and individual heterogeneity is measured through social value orientation and aversion to interpersonal uncertainty. The results show that these measures determine intrinsic predispositions towards cooperation, with more altruistic social values and a higher tolerance towards interpersonal uncertainty leading to more cooperation. The study also finds that intuition enhances predispositions, while deliberation moderates them towards socially acceptable behavior, with individuals with a higher (resp. lower) predisposition towards cooperation becoming more (resp. less) cooperative under time pressure compared to time delay. Overall, the study highlights the importance of individual heterogeneity and context in understanding cooperation and suggests that there is no universal default mode of behavior.","

Some scientifically well-established results—such as the fact that emission of greenhouse gases produces global warming—are rejected by sizable proportions of the population in the United States and other countries. Rejection of scientific findings is mostly driven by motivated cognition: People tend to reject findings that threaten their core beliefs or worldview. At present, rejection of scientific findings by the U.S. public is more prevalent on the political right than the left. Yet the cognitive mechanisms driving rejection of science, such as the superficial processing of evidence toward the desired interpretation, are found regardless of political orientation. General education and scientific literacy do not mitigate rejection of science but, rather, increase the polarization of opinions along partisan lines. In contrast, specific knowledge about the mechanisms underlying a scientific result—such as human-made climate change—can increase the acceptance of that result.",13,"

General education and scientific literacy do not mitigate rejection of science but instead lead to more polarized opinions along partisan lines. However, specific knowledge about the scientific mechanisms behind a result can increase acceptance of it. Overall, this abstract emphasizes the psychological basis for the rejection of scientific findings, particularly in relation to climate change, and suggests that addressing the underlying cognitive mechanisms may be a more effective strategy than simply promoting scientific literacy.","
In relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the abstract touches on two SDGs: SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). The rejection of scientific findings, as discussed in the abstract, can have negative implications for both of these goals.

Firstly, for SDG 3, scientific evidence plays a crucial role in understanding and addressing health-related issues. Rejection of scientific findings on health-related issues can lead to poor decision-making, which can have detrimental impacts on individual and population health. For example, the rejection of scientific evidence on the link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer can result in individuals continuing to smoke, leading to increased risks of cancer and other health problems.

Secondly, for SDG 13, scientific evidence is critical in understanding and addressing the impacts of climate change. The rejection of scientific findings on climate change can lead to inaction, which can result in irreversible and catastrophic consequences for the environment, ecosystems, and human societies. For example, the rejection of scientific evidence on the link between human activities and global warming can result in individuals and societies failing to take action to mitigate the impacts of climate change, leading to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and other adverse effects.

Therefore, the insights and implications from the abstract underscore the importance of addressing the psychological mechanisms driving rejection of scientific findings, particularly in relation to climate change and health-related issues, to promote sustainable development and achieve the SDGs. This can involve providing specific knowledge about the mechanisms underlying scientific findings, as well as addressing the underlying beliefs and worldviews that drive rejection of science.","
SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

While SDG 12 may not be immediately apparent in the abstract, it is relevant as the rejection of scientific findings related to climate change can lead to irresponsible consumption and production patterns. For example, individuals who reject the scientific consensus on human-caused global warming may not take necessary actions to reduce their carbon footprint, contributing to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, companies that prioritize profits over scientific evidence may continue unsustainable practices that harm the environment. Therefore, addressing the psychological mechanisms driving rejection of scientific findings related to climate change can help promote more responsible consumption and production patterns.

SDG 13: Climate Action

SDG 13 is directly related to the abstract's focus on the rejection of scientific findings related to climate change. The abstract highlights that some scientifically well-established results, such as the fact that emission of greenhouse gases produces global warming, are rejected by sizable proportions of the population in the United States and other countries. This rejection can hinder effective climate action, as individuals who reject these findings may not support policies aimed at mitigating climate change or may even actively oppose them. Therefore, understanding the cognitive mechanisms driving rejection of scientific findings related to climate change is crucial for promoting effective climate action.

SDG 15: Life on Land

SDG 15 may not be immediately apparent in the abstract, but it is related as the rejection of scientific findings related to climate change can lead to degradation of ecosystems and wildlife habitats. For example, increased temperatures and sea levels resulting from global warming can lead to the melting of glaciers and ice caps, which can have devastating consequences for ecosystems and wildlife habitats in areas such as the Himalayas and the Arctic. Therefore, addressing the psychological mechanisms driving rejection of scientific findings related to climate change can help promote more sustainable land use patterns and conservation efforts.

In conclusion, the abstract's focus on the rejection of scientific findings related to climate change is relevant to SDGs 12, 13, and 15 as it highlights the importance of addressing the psychological mechanisms driving this rejection for promoting more responsible consumption and production patterns, effective climate action, and sustainable land use patterns and conservation efforts.","

Second, after the abolition of the policy, the ""job survivors"" in the formerly treated group exhibit exactly the same separation behavior as the control group.

Biodiversity ensures ecosystem functioning and provisioning of ecosystem services, but it remains unclear how biodiversity–ecosystem multifunctionality relationships depend on the identity and number of functions considered. Here, we demonstrate that ecosystem multifunctionality, based on 82 indicator variables of ecosystem functions in a grassland biodiversity experiment, increases strongly with increasing biodiversity. Analysing subsets of functions showed that the effects of biodiversity on multifunctionality were stronger when more functions were included and that the strength of the biodiversity effects depended on the identity of the functions included. Limits to multifunctionality arose from negative correlations among functions and functions that were not correlated with biodiversity. Our findings underline that the management of ecosystems for the protection of biodiversity cannot be replaced by managing for particular ecosystem functions or services and emphasize the need for specific management to protect biodiversity. More plant species from the experimental pool of 60 species contributed to functioning when more functions were considered.

As globalization brings people with incompatible attitudes into contact, cultural conflicts inevitably arise. Little is known about how to mitigate conflict and about how the conflicts that occur can shape the cultural evolution of the groups involved. Female genital cutting is a prominent example1, 2, 3. Governments and international agencies have promoted the abandonment of cutting for decades, but the practice remains widespread with associated health risks for millions of girls and women4, 5. In their efforts to end cutting, international agents have often adopted the view that cutting is locally pervasive and entrenched1. This implies the need to introduce values and expectations from outside the local culture. Members of the target society may view such interventions as unwelcome intrusions1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and campaigns promoting abandonment have sometimes led to backlash1, 7, 8, 10, 11 as they struggle to reconcile cultural tolerance with the conviction that cutting violates universal human rights1, 9. Cutting, however, is not necessarily locally pervasive and entrenched1, 3, 12. We designed experiments on cultural change that exploited the existence of conflicting attitudes within cutting societies. We produced four entertaining movies that served as experimental treatments in two experiments in Sudan, and we developed an implicit association test to unobtrusively measure attitudes about cutting. The movies depart from the view that cutting is locally pervasive by dramatizing members of an extended family as they confront each other with divergent views about whether the family should continue cutting. The movies significantly improved attitudes towards girls who remain uncut, with one in particular having a relatively persistent effect. These results show that using entertainment to dramatize locally discordant views can provide a basis for applied cultural evolution without accentuating intercultural divisions.",10,"

3. Approaches to ending FGC: The abstract discusses the approaches adopted by international agencies to end FGC, which often involve introducing values and expectations from outside the local culture. It notes that such interventions may be viewed as unwelcome intrusions by members of the target society, leading to backlash.

4. Changing cultural attitudes: The abstract describes an experimental design that aims to change cultural attitudes towards FGC by using entertainment to dramatize locally discordant views. The movies produced as part of the experiments challenged the view that FGC is locally pervasive and entrenched, leading to significant improvements in attitudes towards girls who remain uncut.

5. Implicit association test: The abstract mentions the use of an implicit association test to unobtrusively measure attitudes about FGC.

6. Cultural evolution: The abstract highlights the potential for cultural conflicts to shape the evolution of cultural practices, particularly in the case of FGC.

7. Backlash: The abstract notes that campaigns promoting abandonment of FGC have sometimes led to backlash due to the perception that such interventions are unwelcome intrusions.

8. Universal human rights: The abstract discusses the tension between cultural tolerance and the conviction that FGC violates universal human rights.

This paper studies cultural representations which critically address the high level of environmental degradation ushered in by successive regimes of China's modernization. On the one hand, it will review a group of blog cartoons reacting to a recent environmental hazard, the Huangpu River floating pigs incident, which were published beginning from mid-March 2013. On the other hand, it looks at intellectual responses to a political economy of short-term profit extraction whose negative impact far exceeds the destruction of the nation's landscapes. Selective readings of lower rungs fiction (diceng wenxue), landscape poetry and multi-media art, and theoretical essays on questions of landscape aesthetics will discuss how these authors express their worries about the consequences of a narrowly functional approach towards natural resources. According to them, the foreclosing of  traditional aesthetic principles that used to support sustainability in modern modes of governance has yielded an unprecedented moral decline of the community as well as an alarming depletion of the nation's non-human recreational powers.

While the relevance of Bacillus (B.) cereus as a major cause of gastroenteritis is undisputed, the role of the closely related B. thuringiensis in foodborne disease is unclear. B. thuringiensis strains frequently harbor enterotoxin genes. However, the organism has only very rarely been associated with foodborne outbreaks, possibly due to the fact that during outbreak investigations, B. cereus is routinely not differentiated from B. thuringiensis. A recent EFSA scientific opinion stresses the urgent need for further data allowing for improved risk assessment, in particular as B. thuringiensis is a commonly used biopesticide. Therefore, the aim of this study was to gain further insights into the hazardous potential of B. thuringiensis. To this end, 39 B. thuringiensis isolates obtained from commercially used biopesticides, various food sources, as well as from foodborne outbreaks were characterized by panC typing, panC-based SplitsTree analysis, toxin gene profiling, FTIR spectroscopic analysis, a cytotoxicity assay screening for enterotoxic activity, and a sphingomyelinase assay. The majority of the tested B. thuringiensis isolates exhibited low (23%, n = 9) or mid level enterotoxicity (74%, n = 29), and produced either no (59%, n = 23) or low levels (33%, n = 13) of sphingomyelinase, which is reported to act synergistically with enterotoxins Nhe and Hbl. One strain isolated from rosemary was however classified as highly enterotoxic surpassing the cytotoxic activity of the high-level reference strain by a factor of 1.5. This strain also produced vast amounts of sphingomyelinase. Combining all results obtained in this study into a fingerprint pattern, several enterotoxic biopesticide strains were indistinguishable from those of isolates from foods or collected in association with outbreaks. Our study shows that many B. thuringiensis biopesticide strains exhibit mid-level cytotoxicity in a Vero cell assay and that some of these strains cannot be differentiated from isolates collected from foods or in association with outbreaks. Thus, we demonstrate that the use of B. thuringiensis strains as biopesticides can represent a food safety risk, underpinning the importance of assessing the hazardous potential of each strain and formulation used.",2,"

Biodiversity loss decreases ecosystem functioning at the local scales at which species interact, but it remains unclear how biodiversity loss affects ecosystem functioning at the larger scales of space and time that are most relevant to biodiversity conservation and policy. Theory predicts that additional insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning could emerge across time and space if species respond asynchronously to environmental variation and if species become increasingly dominant when and where they are most productive. Even if only a few dominant species maintain ecosystem functioning within a particular time and place, ecosystem functioning may be enhanced by many different species across many times and places (β‐diversity). Here, we develop and apply a new approach to estimate these previously unquantified insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning that arise due to species turnover across times and places. In a long‐term (18‐year) grassland plant diversity experiment, we find that total insurance effects are positive in sign and substantial in magnitude, amounting to 19% of the net biodiversity effect, mostly due to temporal insurance effects. Species loss can therefore reduce ecosystem functioning both locally and by eliminating species that would otherwise enhance ecosystem functioning across temporally fluctuating and spatially heterogeneous environments.",15,"

Anthropogenic degradation of natural habitats is a global driver of wildlife population declines. Local population responses to such environmental perturbations are generally well understood, but in socially structured populations, interactions between environmental and social factors may influence population responses. Thus, understanding how habitat degradation affects the dynamics of these populations requires simultaneous consideration of social and environmental mechanisms underlying demographic responses. Here we investigated the effect of habitat degradation through commercial forestry on spatiotemporal dynamics of a group-living bird, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus, in boreal forests of northern Sweden. We assessed the interacting effects of forestry, climate and population density on stage-specific, seasonal life-history rates and population dynamics, using long-term, individual-based demographic data from 70 territories in natural and managed forests. Stage-specific survival and reproductive rates, and consequently population growth, were lower in managed forests than in natural forests. Population growth was most sensitive to breeder survival and was more sensitive to early dispersing juveniles than those delaying dispersal. Forestry decreased population growth in managed forests by reducing reproductive success and breeder survival. Increased snow depth improved winter survival, and warmer spring temperatures enhanced reproductive success, particularly in natural forests. Population growth was stable in natural forests but it was declining in managed forests, and this difference accelerated under forecasted climate scenarios. Thus, climatic change could exacerbate the rate of forestry-induced population decline through reduced snow cover in our study species, and in other species with similar life-history characteristics and habitat requirements.",13,"
The abstract explores the impact of forestry and climate change on the population dynamics of Siberian jays in boreal forests. It investigates how environmental and social factors interact to influence population responses. The study uses long-term, individual-based demographic data from 70 territories in natural and managed forests. The analysis reveals that habitat degradation through commercial forestry lowers stage-specific survival and reproductive rates, resulting in lower population growth in managed forests compared to natural forests. Population growth is most sensitive to breeder survival and early dispersing juveniles. Forestry decreases population growth by reducing reproductive success and breeder survival. However, increased snow depth improves winter survival, and warmer spring temperatures enhance reproductive success, particularly in natural forests. Climate change could accelerate the rate of forestry-induced population decline through reduced snow cover, with a more pronounced effect in managed forests. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering both environmental and social mechanisms underlying demographic responses in understanding how habitat degradation affects population dynamics in group-living bird populations.","
In relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this study has implications for SDG 15 - Life on Land, as it explores the impact of habitat degradation through commercial forestry on the population dynamics of a group-living bird species in boreal forests. The study also touches upon SDG 13 - Climate Action, as it examines how increased snow depth and warmer spring temperatures affect survival and reproductive success in the face of changing climatic conditions. Overall, this research highlights the need to consider the social and environmental factors that influence population responses in group-living bird populations, as well as the importance of maintaining natural forests for the long-term conservation of wildlife populations and their habitats.","
SDG 13: Climate Action
The abstract discusses the impact of climate change on the population dynamics of Siberian jays in boreal forests. The study reveals that warmer spring temperatures enhance reproductive success, particularly in natural forests. However, the analysis also suggests that climatic change could accelerate the rate of forestry-induced population decline through reduced snow cover, with a more pronounced effect in managed forests. Therefore, the study contributes to SDG 13, which aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The abstract explores the impact of forestry and habitat degradation on the population dynamics of Siberian jays in boreal forests. The study finds that habitat degradation through commercial forestry lowers stage-specific survival and reproductive rates, resulting in lower population growth in managed forests compared to natural forests. This contributes to SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and wildlife, while combating poaching and trafficking of protected species.

In summary, the study's findings on the impact of forestry and climate change on the population dynamics of Siberian jays in boreal forests are relevant to both SDG 13 and SDG 15. It highlights the need for urgent action to combat climate change while also protecting and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and wildlife.","
This study examines the effects of forestry and climate change on the population dynamics of Siberian jays in boreal forests, shedding light on the interaction between environmental and social factors in group-living bird populations. The findings indicate that habitat degradation through commercial forestry lowers survival and reproductive rates, leading to lower population growth in managed forests compared to natural forests. Population growth is most sensitive to breeder survival and early dispersing juveniles, and forestry decreases population growth by reducing reproductive success and breeder survival. Warmer spring temperatures enhance reproductive success, but climate change could accelerate the rate of forestry-induced population decline through reduced snow cover, with a more pronounced effect in managed forests. These insights contribute to SDG 13 (Climate Action) by highlighting the need for urgent action to address the impacts of climate change on wildlife populations, and SDG 15 (Life on Land) by underscoring the importance of protecting and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and forests to conserve wildlife populations and their habitats. Overall, this study underscores the need to consider both environmental and social mechanisms underlying demographic responses in understanding how habitat degradation affects population dynamics in group-living bird populations.","

Mountains are key features of the Earth’s surface and host a substantial proportion of the world’s species. However, the links between the evolution and distribution of biodiversity and the formation of mountains remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate multiple datasets to assess the relationships between species richness in mountains, geology and climate at global and regional scales. Specifically, we analyse how erosion, relief, soil and climate relate to the geographical distribution of terrestrial tetrapods, which include amphibians, birds and mammals. We find that centres of species richness correlate with areas of high temperatures, annual rainfall and topographic relief, supporting previous studies. We unveil additional links between mountain-building processes and biodiversity: species richness correlates with erosion rates and heterogeneity of soil types, with a varying response across continents. These additional links are prominent but under-explored, and probably relate to the interplay between surface uplift, climate change and atmospheric circulation through time. They are also influenced by the location and orientation of mountain ranges in relation to air circulation patterns, and how species diversification, dispersal and refugia respond to climate change.

14,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:123721,"Demographic cost and mechanisms of adaptation to environmental stress in resurrected Daphnia
A characteristic feature of the Daphnia (Crustacea: Cladocera) life cycle are the so-called ephippia, which are fertilised eggs that need to undergo diapause. When they are shed by the female, they sink to the lake bottom, where they may become embedded in the sediment and may remain viable for decades. Extracting and hatching ephippia in the laboratory and subjecting resurrected lineages to conditions representative of historic lake environments allows retrospective investigation of life-history responses to environmental change. Here we reanalyse data from such a resurrection experiment (Piscia et al., 2015: Bull. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 94:46–51). Contemporary and past lineages of Daphnia galeata Sars 1863 were obtained from Lake Orta (Italy), a deep, subalpine lake with a well-documented history of industrial copper pollution. Experimental Daphnia were subjected to three copper treatments representative of two levels of historic as well as to current (i.e., unpolluted) lake conditions, and life-table data were collected. With these data at hand, we first estimated vital rates (survival, maturation, and reproduction) and used these rates to project the asymptotic population growth rates (λ) for each population-by-treatment combination. Next, we performed a retrospective decomposition to estimate the contributions of the vital rates to observed differences in λ. Finally, we used elasticity analysis to explore the functional relationship between λ and each of the vital rates. We found that survival rates were only compromised at elevated copper levels. Moreover, past, resurrected Daphnia had a higher λ at low copper concentrations compared to unpolluted conditions, but a lower λ when exposed to high copper levels. Contemporary Daphnia, on the other hand, only reproduced successfully in unpolluted water. Under these conditions, however, they had a higher population growth rate than the past Daphnia, suggesting a cost of copper tolerance in the latter. This cost was mainly due to a lower probability of reproduction and reduced fecundity, whereas survival rates contributed only little to differences in λ. Finally, we found higher elasticity values of λ to survival than to reproductive rates. This suggests that any change in the environment that will affect survival rather than reproductive parameters will have a much larger impact on Lake Orta’s current Daphnia population.",14,"

This abstract touches on several SDGs, particularly SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). Copper pollution has been a historic issue in Lake Orta, Italy, and the study's focus on investigating the effects of copper on the Daphnia population is relevant to SDG 6. The study's results also indicate that the current Daphnia population has a higher population growth rate than the resurrected population, suggesting that the current population may be better adapted to cope with the environmental stressors, which could potentially contribute to achieving SDG 13's goal of combating climate change and its impacts. However, the study also highlights a cost of copper tolerance in the resurrected population, with a lower probability of reproduction and reduced fecundity, which could impact SDG 5 (Gender Equality) as it may affect the population's sex ratio and the reproductive success of females. Ultimately, the study's findings could inform strategies for mitigating the impacts of environmental stressors and preserving aquatic ecosystems, contributing to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by promoting sustainable management of freshwater resources and ecosystems.

As for the implications for the SDGs, this study highlights the importance of preserving freshwater ecosystems and managing environmental stressors, such as copper pollution, to promote sustainable aquatic ecosystems and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Additionally, the study's findings regarding the demographic costs of copper tolerance and the lower probability of reproduction in the resurrected population could inform strategies for promoting gender equality and preserving reproductive success, as the population's sex ratio and reproductive success may be impacted by the copper pollution. Finally, the study's results could also inform strategies for preserving freshwater ecosystems, which are essential for providing clean water and sanitation, as well as promoting sustainable development and preserving terrestrial ecosystems (SDGs 6, 11, and 15).

In summary, this abstract highlights the importance of managing environmental stressors, such as copper pollution, to promote sustainable aquatic ecosystems, combat climate change, preserve gender equality, and promote sustainable development and preservation of terrestrial ecosystems.","

This article is about the relationship between technology and society in fundamental rights theory. So far, the discussion about law and technology has generally been one-directional within the most relevant branches of the social sciences; scholars of the law have been treating technology as a black box when conducting their analyses or developing their theories. In turn, science and technology studies have considered law and regulation as a closed book, which is unsatisfactory as well. Reductionist and compartmentalized theorizing is particularly problematic when it comes to conceiving a fundamental rights theory that is able to cope with challenges of the Internet. Guided by Niklas Luhmann’s autopoietic systems theory, this Article offers novel perspectives that aim at theoretically explaining how affordances can be conceptualized within constitutional rights theory, with the focus on the freedom of the Internet.",9,"
The abstract proposes an exploration of the connection between technology and society in the context of fundamental rights theory. It highlights that previous discussions on law and technology have primarily focused on technology as a separate entity, neglecting its impact on society. This approach is criticized as inadequate, especially when considering the challenges posed by the internet. The abstract suggests that Niklas Luhmann's autopoietic systems theory can provide new insights into how the concept of affordances can be integrated into constitutional rights theory, specifically regarding the freedom of the internet. The abstract concludes that the current reductionist and compartmentalized approaches are problematic, particularly in understanding the relationship between law and technology.","
The abstract suggests potential implications for SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) as technology and society are intricately connected in fundamental rights theory. The proposed analysis, guided by Luhmann's systems theory, can shed light on how affordances, which refer to the inherent potentialities of a technology or object, can be integrated into constitutional rights theory, specifically regarding the freedom of the internet. This could have implications for ensuring access to technology and innovation for all, as affordances can be seen as opportunities for social and economic development. Additionally, the analysis could contribute to developing strong institutions and promoting peace and justice by understanding how technology and society intersect in fundamental rights theory. However, more research is needed to determine the specific impacts on these SDGs.

Freshwater ecosystems rely on allochthonous resources. Integration of these subsidies depends on diversity of both terrestrial resources and aquatic shredder and decomposer communities, but the diversity effects on leaf litter breakdown and decomposition are less clear in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. We need a better understanding of this relationship because aquatic communities are rapidly changing with species invasions and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we experimentally disentangled the effects of leaf and shredder richness on leaf litter breakdown by macroinvertebrates in mesocosm experiments using three species of amphipods, a dominant guild of crustaceans in European freshwater ecosystems. Increased leaf richness led to lower-than-predicted leaf consumption by native shredders, with mixed evidence of resource-switching or prioritization of preferred food items within a leaf mix. Higher shredder species richness never promoted leaf consumption rates compared to predictions from relevant single-species experiments, and instead sometimes substantially decreased leaf consumption. We then conducted a meta-analysis of leaf litter consumption rates by seven widely distributed amphipod species (the three used in the experiments and four additional species). As expected based on our own experiments, nonnative amphipod species generally had lower biomass- adjusted leaf litter consumption rates, although their larger body size led to higher per-individual leaf consumption rates. Contamination of the water by metals, pesticides, and other chemicals additionally significantly decreased leaf litter consumption by multiple native and nonnative species compared to unpolluted systems. While the meta-analysis suggested that litter consumption, and thus breakdown, would decline if native shredders are replaced by nonnative heterospecifics, complete species replacement is not the only outcome following immigration in a meta-community context. Our experiments suggest that breakdown rates could remain reasonably high where native species coexist with nonnative arrivals. Experiments that neglect the ecological realism of species coexistence will necessarily mischaracterize effects on ecosystem functioning.",14,"

In a rural agrarian economy like that of Nepal, land has traditionally been a primary source of livelihood and security, as well as a symbol of status. Thousands of poor farmers are completely dependent on land for their livelihoods, yet not all of them have access to or control over this fundamental resource. Negotiation for access to land has been a lengthy and complicated process. It remains so in the changed political context of Nepal, where increasing numbers of emerging actors need to be considered, often with conflicting claims and counterclaims. In this context the traditional ways of thinking need to be revised, both with regard to the negotiating process and the mechanisms of land reform, to accommodate the country’s recent and ongoing massive socio-economic transformation.",1,"
The abstract ""Negotiating access to land in Nepal"" highlights the significance of land as a source of livelihood, security, and status in rural Nepal, where many poor farmers are completely dependent on it. However, not all farmers have access to or control over this resource, leading to a lengthy and complicated negotiation process. In Nepal's new political context, emerging actors with conflicting claims and counterclaims further complicate the negotiations. The abstract calls for a revision of traditional ways of thinking about the negotiation process and land reform mechanisms to accommodate Nepal's ongoing socio-economic transformation. Therefore, the core themes and subjects addressed in this abstract include the crucial role of land in rural Nepalese communities, the challenges and complexities of negotiating access to land in a changing political context, and the need for reevaluation of traditional approaches to land reform in light of Nepal's current transformation. The methodology or approach used is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that qualitative research methods, such as interviews and case studies, may be employed to analyze and understand the negotiation process and its outcomes. The key findings or conclusions suggest a need for accommodating emerging actors and their conflicting claims in the negotiation process and adapting land reform mechanisms to the changing political and economic context.","
Based on the core themes, we can extract insights related to the following SDGs:

1. SDG 1 - No Poverty: The abstract highlights the dependence of poor farmers on land as a primary source of livelihood, indicating the importance of addressing land access and control issues to alleviate poverty.

2. SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation: The abstract does not explicitly address this SDG, but it can be inferred that ensuring access to clean water and sanitation facilities may also be a factor in negotiating land access and control, as many rural communities rely on natural resources like water sources and agricultural land for their daily needs.

3. SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy: The abstract does not explicitly address this SDG, but it can be inferred that ensuring access to affordable and clean energy may also be a factor in negotiating land access and control, as many rural communities rely on traditional forms of energy like wood and agricultural waste for their daily needs, which may impact land use and availability.

4. SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities: The abstract highlights the inequality in land access and control, indicating the need for addressing this issue to reduce inequalities and promote a more equitable distribution of resources.

5. SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities: The abstract touches upon the need to revise traditional ways of thinking about land reform mechanisms to accommodate Nepal's ongoing socio-economic transformation, indicating the importance of promoting sustainable land use practices and urbanization patterns.

Overall, the abstract suggests the need for addressing land access and control issues in rural Nepalese communities to alleviate poverty, reduce inequalities, and promote sustainable land use practices in light of Nepal's ongoing socio-economic transformation. It also implies the need for accommodating emerging actors and their conflicting claims in the negotiation process and adapting land reform mechanisms to the changing political and economic context.","
SDG 1: No Poverty
The abstract highlights the crucial role of land as a source of livelihood for many poor farmers in Nepal. Therefore, addressing the challenges and complexities of negotiating access to land in a changing political context can have a significant impact on poverty alleviation efforts. If poor farmers can secure access to land, they can potentially increase their agricultural productivity, leading to improved livelihoods and reducing poverty levels. SDG 1 aims to eradicate poverty in all its forms everywhere, and this research can contribute to achieving this goal by identifying effective strategies for negotiating land access and promoting inclusive land reform policies.

SDG 2: Zero Hunger
Access to land is also essential for food security and achieving SDG 2. In Nepal, agriculture is the primary source of food, and poor farmers heavily depend on their land for subsistence. If they can secure access to land, they can potentially increase crop yields and ensure food security for their families and communities. By identifying effective strategies for negotiating land access and promoting inclusive land reform policies, this research can contribute to achieving SDG 2 by promoting sustainable agriculture practices and food security.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
The abstract also highlights the increasing number of emerging actors with conflicting claims and counterclaims in the negotiation process for land access. Addressing these conflicts requires strong institutions and mechanisms for conflict resolution. This research can contribute to achieving SDG 16 by identifying effective strategies for addressing conflicts in the negotiation process and promoting inclusive and equitable land reform policies that are consistent with Nepal's changing political context.

While SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 4 (Quality Education) do not seem immediately relevant to this research, it is worth mentioning that access to land is also linked to health and education outcomes. Poor farmers who secure access to land can potentially improve their health outcomes by increasing access to nutritious foods and reducing poverty-related health issues. Additionally, children from poor families who have access to land can potentially improve their education outcomes by being able to attend school instead of working on the farm. Therefore, this research can also contribute to achieving SDG 3 and SDG 4 by promoting inclusive land reform policies that consider health and education outcomes.

With the help of sociological systems theory, this text argues that the social and legal institutionalisation of constitutional rights need to be distinguished. Commonly, constitutional rights emerge from society before they are reformulated in the legal realm. Using the example of the United States, the paper shows empirically that net neutrality is about to emerge as a new fundamental value and right. Its constitutionalisation is happening bottom-up, driven by social movements, Internet activists and advocacy groups, and further, in an interweavement of civil society dynamics with the legal system. The question is whether constitutional structures have already become identifiable. The last section discusses the relationship between social and formal constitutional structures from a legitimacy and democracy perspective.",9,"
In this abstract, the author explores the concept of net neutrality and its emergence as a constitutional right. The author argues that net neutrality has evolved from a niche issue to a key value for contemporary society, and is being institutionalized as a constitutional right. The author uses sociological systems theory to distinguish between the social and legal institutionalization of constitutional rights. Empirical evidence from the United States is presented to demonstrate that net neutrality is emerging as a new fundamental value and right, with its constitutionalization happening bottom-up through social movements, Internet activists, and advocacy groups. The author questions whether constitutional structures have already become identifiable and discusses the relationship between social and formal constitutional structures from a legitimacy and democracy perspective.","
In relation to the Sustainable Development Goals, this abstract touches on SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions. The emergence of net neutrality as a constitutional right is a result of social movements and advocacy groups advocating for the protection of this value. This bottom-up constitutionalization process promotes a more participatory and inclusive democratic system, aligning with SDG 16's goal of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. This process also contributes to SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals, as it highlights the importance of partnerships between civil society, social movements, and legal institutions in achieving sustainable development goals.","

19,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:152882,"Considering our methods: Methodological issues with rodent models of appetite and obesity research
A large number of animal models are currently used in appetite and obesity research. Because the worldwide incidence of obesity continues to climb, it is imperative that animal models sharing characteristics of human obesity and its co-morbidities be used appropriately in the quest for novel preventions or treatments. There is probably no animal model, at least in rodents, that recapitulates all aspects of ""common"" human obesity and its comorbidities, but rodent models allow insight into specific mechanisms of disease or its consequences. Frequently used obesity models can be partitioned into different categories, the major ones being a) based on mutations or manipulations of one or a few individual genes or b) those in genetically intact animals exposed to obesogenic environments such as, e.g., being maintained on high-fat diets or being raised in small litters. Characteristics of these models include distinct phenotypes of obesity, hyperphagia or changes in energy metabolism, and frequent comorbidities of obesity, like hyperglycemia, insulin resistance or diabetes-like syndromes. This review which is based on a presentation given during the Annual Meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior in July 2017 points out some observations and characteristics of rodent models in obesity and diabetes research. The choice of rodent models discussed here is subjective and based on the author's own experience or on fruitful discussions with colleagues about the pros and cons of specific models. Hence, this review, by no means, is meant to give a complete picture of rodent models used in this type of research, but the review tries to bring up some issues which, in the author's mind, may also be relevant for models not discussed here. For example, by discussing specific mouse and rat models, similarities and differences between mice and rats will be discussed that need to be considered to interpret experimental findings cautiously and in the context of the respective animal model. Knowing which animal model to use means, knowing its limitations.",3,"

The rapidly increasing interest of foreign investors in land in the global South, also termed land grabbing, has been widely discussed as potentially supportive, but often rather harmful for local populations. Combining a critical livelihoods perspective with access theory and a bargaining model, this study scrutinizes local people’s perceptions of the land investments, power relations during land negotiations and intra-community differences. By analysing two European forestry companies in Tanzania, we have chosen a sector and a country with presumably more positive outcomes for local populations. The deals resulted in not only labour opportu- nities and infrastructural improvements, which are mainly perceived as positive, but also cases of violated land rights, inadequate compensation and decreased food security. Hence, even under favourable preconditions, the consequences for local people are ambivalent. With this study, we contribute to a differentiated analysis of the contested role of large-scale land deals in contemporary rural development.",1,"

The bioassessment of aquatic ecosystems is currently based on various biotic indices that use the occurrence and/ or abundance of selected taxonomic groups to define ecological status. These conventional indices have some limitations, often related to difficulties in morphological identification of bioindicator taxa. Recent development of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding could potentially alleviate some of these limitations, by using DNA sequences instead of morphology to identify organisms and to characterize a given ecosystem. In this paper, we review the structure of conventional biotic indices, and we present the results of pilot metabarcoding studies using environmental DNA to infer biotic indices. We discuss the main advantages and pitfalls of metabarcoding approaches to assess parameters such as richness, abundance, taxonomic composition and species ecological values, to be used for calculation of biotic indices. We present some future developments to fully exploit the potential of metabarcoding data and improve the accuracy and precision of their analysis.

22,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:87341,"Legitimacy-as-Feeling: How affect leads to vertical legitimacy spillovers in transnational governance
Transnational governance schemes (TGSs) are interorganizational networks of public and/or private actors that jointly regulate global public policy issues, such as the prevention of human rights violations and the protection of ecosystems. Considering that TGSs mainly address issues of public concern, the general public represents a major source of legitimacy in transnational governance. We theorize how members of the general public, whom we conceptualize as intuiters, apply heuristics to bestow legitimacy on TGSs. Given the difficulty of assessing TGSs, we argue that intuiters draw on affect-based responses towards a TGS's better-known network affiliates, such as participating business firms, to judge the legitimacy of the TGS as a whole. This substitution produces a “vertical” legitimacy spillover. More specifically, we examine the heuristic process of judgment underlying vertical spillovers in TGSs and derive implications for the legitimacy construct and the analysis of spillover phenomena.",12,"
The abstract presents a theory on how individuals outside of transnational governance schemes (TGSs) contribute to their legitimacy. It proposes that these individuals, referred to as intuiters, use affect-based responses towards TGS affiliates such as participating businesses to judge the legitimacy of the TGS as a whole. This is called a vertical legitimacy spillover. The abstract suggests that this heuristic process of judgment is a substitution for the difficulty of assessing TGSs directly. The theory has implications for the legitimacy construct and the analysis of spillover phenomena in transnational governance.","
The abstract discusses legitimacy in transnational governance schemes (TGSs), which address global public policy issues such as human rights violations and ecosystem protection. The role of the general public in legitimizing TGSs is emphasized, with intuiters (members of the general public) using affect-based responses towards TGS affiliates like participating businesses to judge the legitimacy of the TGS as a whole. This process is called a vertical legitimacy spillover, where legitimacy is transferred from the affiliates to the TGS. This theory has implications for the legitimacy construct and spillover phenomena analysis in transnational governance.

This theory has implications for several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions - promotes accountable and inclusive institutions, which includes transnational governance. The legitimacy of TGSs is crucial for their effectiveness and adherence, as it ensures their acceptance by the public and reduces the likelihood of opposition. The theory suggests that intuiters' affect-based responses towards TGS affiliates, which can include private sector actors, contribute to the legitimacy of the TGS. This highlights the role of the private sector in supporting TGSs and their contribution to the SDGs.

Additionally, the theory's implications for SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production - are also significant. TGSs often address issues related to sustainable consumption and production patterns, such as ecosystem protection. The legitimacy of these TGSs can contribute to their effectiveness in achieving the SDGs. By promoting the legitimacy of TGSs, intuiters are more likely to support and participate in these initiatives, leading to more responsible consumption and production patterns. This aligns with the SDG's aim to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.

Moreover, the theory's implications for SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals - are also relevant. The theory suggests that intuiters' affect-based responses towards TGS affiliates, including private sector actors, contribute to the legitimacy of the TGS. This highlights the importance of partnerships between TGSs and the private sector in achieving the SDGs. The theory's implications also suggest that partnerships between TGSs and the private sector can contribute to the legitimacy of the T","
SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The proposed theory has indirect relevance to SDG 12. The intuiters' affect-based responses towards TGS affiliates, such as participating businesses, could influence their purchasing decisions and preferences, thereby promoting responsible consumption and production. This is because TGSs often focus on global public policy issues such as preventing human rights violations and protecting ecosystems. If these intuiters perceive TGS affiliates as legitimate, they may be more inclined to choose products and services associated with these affiliates, which could translate into increased demand for sustainable and responsible products.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions

The proposed theory has direct relevance to SDG 16. TGSs often address issues related to peace, justice, and strong institutions, such as preventing human rights violations and promoting the rule of law. By bestowing legitimacy on TGS affiliates through affect-based responses, intuiters contribute to the strengthening of institutions, which is a critical aspect of achieving SDG 16. This legitimacy could also help to prevent or mitigate conflicts and promote peaceful solutions to global public policy issues.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

The proposed theory has direct relevance to SDG 17. TGSs are interorganizational networks that involve partnerships between public and private actors. By bestowing legitimacy on TGS affiliates through affect-based responses, intuiters contribute to the strengthening of these partnerships, which is a critical aspect of achieving SDG 17. This legitimacy could also help to promote transparency, accountability, and effective governance, which are crucial elements of partnerships for the goals.

In conclusion, while the proposed theory does not directly address SDGs 12, 16, and 17, it has indirect and direct relevance to these SDGs, respectively. As a result, the theory's contribution to these SDGs should not be overlooked, and further research could help to identify the full extent of this relevance.","

This article investigates how changes in same-sex rights affect attitudes toward homosexuality. We argue that different same-sex relationship policies vary in their impact. Whereas registered partnership laws construct a distinct target population that receives new benefits, marriage equality sends an unambiguously positive signal and reduces the perceived group difference through inclusion into existing rights. As a consequence, marriage equality should have a positive effect on attitudes toward homosexuality, whereas partnership laws should have much less positive effects and could even lead to backlash among some groups. Combining data from eight waves of the European Social Survey with data on legislation, we analyze the effects of same-sex marriage, registered partnerships, and marriage bans on attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Marriage has a positive effect, bans and registered partnerships have a negative effect. Legalized partnership is especially associated with significantly more negative attitudes among nonreligious and less educated people.",10,"
This abstract explores the relationship between same-sex rights and public attitudes towards homosexuality in Europe. The authors suggest that different types of same-sex relationship policies have varying impacts on attitudes. Registered partnership laws, which create a distinct target population with new benefits, have less positive effects than marriage equality, which sends a positive signal and reduces the perceived group difference through inclusion into existing rights. Using data from the European Social Survey and legislation, the authors find that marriage equality has a positive effect on attitudes, while registered partnerships and marriage bans have negative effects. Notably, legalized partnership is associated with more negative attitudes among nonreligious and less educated individuals. Overall, the authors argue that the impact of same-sex rights on attitudes is complex and depends on the specific policy in question.","
This abstract touches on SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, as the authors note that the effects of same-sex rights policies on attitudes differ for nonreligious and less educated individuals. These groups may experience more negative attitudes in response to registered partnerships, highlighting the need to consider the potential impact of policies on marginalized communities. Additionally, SDG 5 - Gender Equality is related to this topic, as same-sex rights are a crucial component of achieving gender equality and promoting the human rights of all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. However, the authors' findings suggest that progress in this area may still face opposition, emphasizing the ongoing importance of advocating for and protecting these rights. Overall, this research contributes to a broader understanding of how social policies can impact attitudes and reinforce inequalities, which is relevant to SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions, as it highlights the need for policies that promote equality, justice, and human rights for all.","
SDG 5: Gender Equality
- This abstract discusses how same-sex rights affect public attitudes towards homosexuality, which is a topic relevant to gender equality. The authors argue that marriage equality, which includes same-sex couples in existing rights, reduces the perceived group difference and has a positive effect on attitudes. This aligns with SDG 5, which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. By promoting the inclusion of same-sex couples in existing rights, this policy can contribute to reducing the perceived group difference and promoting equality for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
- The authors highlight that the impact of same-sex rights on attitudes is complex and varies depending on the specific policy in question. Legalized partnership, for example, is associated with more negative attitudes among nonreligious and less educated individuals. This suggests that the implementation of same-sex rights policies may not have equal positive effects for all individuals, and could even lead to backlash among some groups. This aligns with SDG 10, which aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries. By acknowledging that the impact of same-sex rights policies may not be uniform, policymakers can work towards ensuring that these policies do not inadvertently perpetuate inequalities based on factors such as religion or education level.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
- This abstract discusses the relationship between same-sex rights and public attitudes towards homosexuality, which can impact social cohesion and the functioning of institutions. The authors suggest that policies such as registered partnerships, which create a distinct target population with new benefits, have less positive effects than marriage equality, which reduces the perceived group difference through inclusion into existing rights. This aligns with SDG 16, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, and to ensure access to justice for all. By promoting policies that reduce the perceived group difference and promote social cohesion, this can contribute to peaceful and inclusive societies, and to ensuring access to justice for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.

- While this abstract is not directly related to SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, it is worth mentioning that the implementation of same-sex rights policies could indirectly impact the environment. Studies","
The given abstract explores the relationship between same-sex rights and public attitudes towards homosexuality in Europe, highlighting the complexity of the impact of such policies on attitudes. The authors suggest that while registered partnership laws have less positive effects than marriage equality, legalized partnerships could lead to more negative attitudes among nonreligious and less educated individuals. This underscores the need to consider the potential impact of policies on marginalized communities, particularly in line with SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities.

Additionally, the authors' findings align with SDG 5 - Gender Equality, as marriage equality, which includes same-sex couples in existing rights, reduces the perceived group difference and has a positive effect on attitudes. This policy promotes equality for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, and supports the objective of achieving gender equality.

Furthermore, the authors suggest that policies that reduce the perceived group difference and promote social cohesion, such as marriage equality, can contribute to peaceful and inclusive societies and ensure access to justice for all individuals, as outlined by SDG 16 - Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions.

While the abstract does not directly relate to SDG 15 - Life on Land, it is worth mentioning that the implementation of same-sex rights policies could indirectly impact the environment, as studies have shown that social policies can impact attitudes and behaviors related to environmental conservation. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the broader impacts of policies and their alignment with the SDGs, including SDG 15, as part of a holistic and sustainable approach to policy-making.

In summary, the abstract highlights the importance of promoting same-sex rights policies that reduce the perceived group difference, promote social cohesion, and ensure access to justice for all individuals, while also considering their potential impacts on marginalized communities and the broader environment. These policies align with SDG 5, SDG 10, SDG 16, and SDG 15, and can contribute to a more inclusive, just, and sustainable society.","

The provided abstract summarizes two recent publications in the fields of globalization and development. Both books examine the impact of globalization on specific regions, namely West Africa and the Caribbean, and highlight the uneven development that results.

Stefan Ouma's ""Assembling Export Markets: The Making and Unmaking of Global Food Connections in West Africa"" explores the evolution of West Africa's agricultural export market. Ouma argues that the region's integration into global markets has led to both opportunities and challenges. While the opening of markets has facilitated access to new customers, it has also introduced competition and price volatility. Ouma's study focuses on the role of intermediaries in assembling export markets and the implications of this process for local economies and communities.

Marion Werner's ""Global Displacements: The Making of Uneven Development in the Caribbean"" examines the uneven development patterns that have emerged in the Caribbean as a result of globalization. Werner's analysis highlights the ways in which global capital has reshaped the region's economy, leading to the displacement of traditional industries and the emergence of new ones. Werner argues that this process has created significant inequalities within the region, with some communities benefiting from globalization while others are left behind.

Both authors employ a critical perspective, questioning the assumptions and narratives that underpin globalization and its impacts. They both highlight the importance of understanding the historical and political contexts that shape globalization, and the need to consider the social, political, and economic dimensions of development. Their research sheds light on the complex and often contradictory ways in which globalization affects local communities and economies, and underscores the need for more nuanced and context-specific approaches to development.

26,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:149191,"How Political is Political Consumption? The Case of Activism for the Global South and Fair Trade
Political consumption is a flourishing field of research at the intersection of consumer research and political sociology. Political consumption means the consideration of ethical or political motives in the decision to buy certain products. Its main forms are the buying (buycott) of products distinguished by certain ethical or political characteristics such as sustainability, social justice, or corporate responsibility, and the boycott of products that lack such characteristics. However, there is an ongoing discussion about the status of political consumption. Some authors suspect that it may distract citizens from more challenging forms of participation (crowding-out thesis). In contrast, most empirical research has shown that political consumers are also more active than the general population in other forms of political participation. However, this has only been shown for fairly general measures of political consumption and participation. Our contribution to this debate thus focuses on one specific form of political consumption and corresponding forms of participation: activism for the Global South and fair trade consumption, zooming in on the case of Switzerland, where fair trade consumption is quite widespread within the population. Our results show that fair trade consumption is only weakly related to other forms of engagement for Global South issues, thus it does not distract from more challenging forms of engagement, but it is also not part of a more general engaged lifestyle. This is supported by the fact that the motivations and structural underpinnings of other forms of activism for the Global South differ from those of fair trade consumption.",12,"
The abstract explores the debate surrounding political consumption, specifically related to activism for the Global South and fair trade products. The authors question whether political consumption may distract individuals from more challenging forms of political participation, as suggested by some scholars (crowding-out thesis). However, most empirical research has shown that political consumers are more active in other forms of political participation. The study focuses on the specific form of political consumption related to fair trade products in Switzerland, where fair trade consumption is prevalent. The results reveal that fair trade consumption is not strongly associated with other forms of engagement for Global South issues, indicating that it does not distract from more challenging forms of engagement. Additionally, the study finds that the motivations and structural underpinnings of other forms of activism for the Global South differ from those of fair trade consumption.","
This abstract touches upon several SDGs related to social justice and sustainable consumption and production patterns. Specifically, it addresses:

SDG 1 - No Poverty: The focus on fair trade products in the Global South can be linked to poverty reduction efforts, as fair trade certification ensures that small-scale producers receive a fair price for their goods and are not exploited. This can contribute to poverty alleviation and promote sustainable livelihoods.

SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production: The study highlights the role of political consumption in promoting responsible consumption patterns, as consumers consider the social and political implications of their purchases. This can lead to more sustainable and equitable consumption patterns, in line with SDG 12.

SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: The study's focus on fair trade consumption and activism for the Global South underscores the importance of partnerships between producers, consumers, and organizations working to promote social justice and sustainable development. Collaborative efforts can help to promote fair trade practices, reduce poverty, and promote sustainable consumption patterns, in line with SDG 17.

The study's findings also shed light on SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, as it highlights that fair trade consumption is not necessarily linked to other forms of engagement for Global South issues. This suggests that fair trade consumption may not necessarily lead to a broader reduction in inequalities, and that more comprehensive and structural approaches are needed to address this SDG.

Overall, the study's focus on fair trade consumption and activism for the Global South highlights the interconnectedness of social justice, sustainable consumption and production patterns, and poverty reduction efforts. These issues are all linked to several SDGs and require collaborative efforts and partnerships to promote positive outcomes.","
SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
The abstract discusses the concept of political consumption, which involves considering ethical and political motives when making consumption decisions. The study focuses on fair trade products, a specific form of political consumption, and its relationship with other forms of political participation. The results suggest that fair trade consumption is not strongly related to other forms of engagement for Global South issues, indicating that it does not distract from more challenging forms of engagement. This highlights the importance of responsible consumption and production as a means of achieving SDG 12, which aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. By encouraging the consumption of fair trade products, we can promote sustainable and equitable production practices, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and responsible global economy.

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
The study also sheds light on the structural underpinnings of other forms of activism for the Global South, which differ from those of fair trade consumption. This highlights the importance of understanding the different factors that drive activism and engagement in this area. By gaining a deeper understanding of the structural underpinnings of activism, we can better design policies and interventions that promote industry, innovation, and infrastructure in ways that contribute to the achievement of SDG 9. Additionally, by promoting the consumption of fair trade products, we can support the development of sustainable and equitable supply chains, which can contribute to the growth of local industries and the creation of new job opportunities. This, in turn, can contribute to the achievement of SDG 9 by promoting sustainable and equitable economic growth.

While fair trade consumption and engagement for the Global South are related, the study suggests that they are not strongly associated. This highlights the importance of promoting both fair trade consumption and engagement for the Global South as separate but complementary approaches to achieving SDG 12 and SDG 9. By doing so, we can promote sustainable and equitable economic growth while also supporting the development of local industries and communities in the Global South.

In summary, the study's findings highlight the importance of responsible consumption and production patterns, as well as the promotion of sustainable and equitable economic growth, in achieving SDG 12 and SDG 9. By promoting both fair trade consumption and engagement for the Global South, we can contribute to the achievement of these SDGs in a complementary and holistic manner.","

28,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:141007,"Comparing species interaction networks along environmental gradients
Knowledge of species composition and their interactions, in the form of interaction networks, is required to understand processes shaping their distribution over time and space. As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.",15,"
The abstract explores the concept of comparing ecological interaction networks across environmental gradients. It highlights the importance of understanding how species interactions change in response to environmental factors, as this can shed light on the processes shaping their distribution over time and space. The abstract notes that while the study of species composition has a long history, the investigation of changes in species interactions between networks is a relatively new research avenue. 

The abstract outlines two approaches for examining variation in network structures along environmental gradients: directly comparing network properties or using a procedure of standardization. Standardization involves controlling for certain co-variables or using null models to compare the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations. The abstract argues that standardization can facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties, but cautions that different forms of standardization can highlight different signals and should not be compared indiscriminately.

In addition, we surveyed the literature to review the effect of body mass on core body temperature range in relation to environmental temperature in the Testudinidae. Diurnal activity of tortoises was bimodally distributed and influenced by environmental temperature and season. The mean air temperature at which activity is maximized was 27.9°C, with a range of 25.8–31.7°C. Furthermore, air temperature explained changes in the core body temperature better than did mass, and only during the coldest trial, did tortoises with higher mass show more stable temperatures. Our results, together with the overall Testudinidae overview, suggest that, once variation in environmental temperature has been taken into account, there is little effect of mass on the temperature stability of tortoises. Moreover, the presence of thermal inertia in an individual tortoise depends on the environmental temperatures, and we found no evidence for inertial homeothermy.

31,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:164827,"Identifying relapse prevention elements during psychological treatment of depression: Development of an observer-based rating instrument
BACKGROUND
Although observer-rated instruments assessing therapist's adherence to relapse-preventive treatments are available, they do not adequately cover specific relapse-preventive elements that focus on implementation of strategies after terminating treatment. This study describes the development of the KERI-D (Kodierbogen zur Erfassung Rückfallprophylaktischer Interventionen bei Depression/Coding System to Assess Interventions of Relapse Prevention in Depression). The KERI-D is a new observer-based rating tool for acute or continuation/maintenance-phase sessions and assesses relapse-prevention elements including implementation into patient's daily routines.
METHODS
The development of the KERI-D included iterative steps referring to theoretical, clinical and empirical sources. It consists of 19 content items within four categories (self-care, early warning signs, triggering events/situations, termination of therapy) and one global item. For empirical analyses, videotaped psychotherapy sessions of 36 psychotherapies were rated by three independent observers and analyzed for their psychometric properties.
RESULTS
Most items showed moderate to good inter-rater reliability (median ICC = .80) and retest reliability (median ICC = .93). Principal-axis factor analysis revealed three subscales, and first evidence of content validity was demonstrated. No associations with clinical follow-up data were found.
LIMITATIONS
Analysis was limited to a relatively small sample of selected psychotherapy sessions. Evaluation of predictive validity is a desirable next step to further examine applicability and scope of the instrument.
CONCLUSIONS
The KERI-D is the first observer-based rating instrument measuring specific relapse-prevention strategies in psychotherapy for depression. It may help to identify elements that prove effective in reducing relapse/recurrence in the long-term and thereby help to optimize effect duration of depression treatment.",3,"
The abstract presents the development of a new observer-based rating instrument, the KERI-D, for assessing relapse-prevention elements during psychological treatment of depression. The instrument covers specific strategies for implementing relapse-preventive elements after the end of treatment, which are not adequately covered by existing observer-rated instruments. The KERI-D consists of 19 content items organized into four categories and one global item. The development process involved iterative steps based on theoretical, clinical, and empirical sources. Empirical analyses showed moderate to good inter-rater reliability and retest reliability, with three subscales identified through principal-axis factor analysis. While no associations were found with clinical follow-up data, the instrument demonstrates content validity, making it the first observer-based rating instrument for measuring specific relapse-prevention strategies in psychotherapy for depression. Further evaluation of predictive validity is recommended to determine the instrument's applicability and scope. Overall, the KERI-D has the potential to help identify effective strategies for reducing relapse/recurrence and optimizing the duration of depression treatment.","
In relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the development of the KERI-D has implications for SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being, as it focuses on preventing relapses and reducing recurrence of depression, which is a major health issue worldwide. By identifying effective strategies for implementing relapse-preventive elements after the end of treatment, the KERI-D can contribute to SDG 3 by improving access to and the effectiveness of mental health treatments, which is a key target under SDG 3. Additionally, as depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, the KERI-D has the potential to contribute to SDG 1 - No Poverty and SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, as better management of depression can lead to increased productivity, reduced healthcare costs, and improved economic opportunities for those affected by the condition. The development of the KERI-D also highlights the importance of innovative, evidence-based approaches for addressing mental health concerns, which is aligned with SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. Overall, while the KERI-D does not directly contribute to any of the SDGs, its development and potential applications have implications for promoting sustainable development by improving access to and the effectiveness of mental health treatments, which can contribute to several SDGs.","
3. Good Health and Well-being: The development and validation of the KERI-D can contribute to achieving this SDG by improving the effectiveness and duration of depression treatment, ultimately leading to better mental health outcomes for individuals with depression. The instrument's ability to identify specific relapse-prevention strategies can also help in developing and implementing more effective depression treatment programs, which can lead to a reduction in relapse rates and improved overall well-being.

16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions: While it may not be immediately apparent how the KERI-D contributes to this SDG, it can have indirect effects. By improving the effectiveness of depression treatment programs, individuals may be better equipped to manage stressors and cope with challenging situations, which can lead to greater peace and justice in their communities. Additionally, the development of the KERI-D highlights the importance of strong institutions, such as mental health care systems, in supporting individuals with depression and promoting overall well-being.

15. Life on Land: The abstract does not explicitly address how the KERI-D contributes to this SDG, as it is focused on depression treatment and does not address environmental issues. However, it should be noted that poor mental health can have negative impacts on individuals' ability to contribute to and engage in activities related to this SDG, such as conservation efforts. By improving depression treatment programs, the KERI-D can contribute to better overall mental health, which in turn can lead to greater engagement and contribution to environmental initiatives.

Overall, the KERI-D has the potential to contribute to the achievement of multiple SDGs by improving mental health outcomes, promoting strong institutions, and ultimately leading to greater overall well-being. However, further research is needed to fully understand the instrument's predictive validity and scope, as well as its potential impacts on environmental initiatives related to SDG 15.","

32,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:138693,"Giant tortoise habitats under increasing drought conditions on Aldabra Atoll—Ecological indicators to monitor rainfall anomalies and related vegetation activity
Aldabra Atoll has the largest population of giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) in the world. As such an important biological resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we calculated the standardized, precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969–2013. We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought months per year today compared with about two months per year in the 1970s (t =2.884, p=0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between 2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra’s vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the habitat composition across the atoll.",13,"
The abstract discusses the impact of drought frequency on the habitat of giant tortoises in Aldabra Atoll, which has the largest population of these animals in the world. The authors analyze precipitation data over the past 50 years using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods. They find that drought frequency has increased from two months per year in the 1970s to more than six months per year today (t = 2.884, p = 0.006).

To assess how vegetation has responded to these changes, the authors use MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity between 2000 and 2013. They find that Aldabra's vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall, with anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI decreasing below the mean during most drought periods and increasing above the mean during most non-drought periods.

The authors then investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall by extracting mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, which are the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. This suggests that the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within favored habitats and changing the habitat composition across the atoll.

Overall, the authors' analysis indicates that the increased frequency of drought on Aldabra could have significant consequences for the tortoise population, both in the short and long term.","

The increased frequency of drought could limit the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within preferred habitats, potentially affecting the tortoise population in both the short and long term. This highlights the importance of sustainable land use and management practices to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect vulnerable species and ecosystems. Additionally, the authors' use of MODIS NDVI as a proxy for vegetation activity relates to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) as it demonstrates the importance of utilizing advanced technologies and scientific methods to monitor and conserve natural resources. Overall, this abstract has implications for SDGs 6, 12, and 15, highlighting the interconnectedness of environmental sustainability and conservation efforts.","

Does neglecting the possibility that fossil fuel reserves become “stranded” result in a ""carbon bubble"", i.e., an overvaluation of fossil fuel firms? To address this question, we study whether banks price the climate policy risk. We hand collect global data on corporate fossil fuel reserves, match it with syndicated loans, and subsequently compare the loan rate charged to fossil fuel firms-along their climate policy exposure-to non-fossil fuel firms. We find that before 2015 banks did not price climate policy risk. After 2015, however, the risk is priced, especially for firms holding more fossil fuel reserves. We also provide some evidence that ""green banks"" charge marginally higher loan rates to fossil fuel firms.",13,"

To optimize removal of organic micropollutants from the water cycle, understanding the processes during activated sludge treatment is essential. In this study, we hypothesize that aliphatic amines, which are highly abundant among organic micropollutants, are partly removed from the water phase in activated sludge through ion trapping in protozoa. In ion trapping, which has been extensively investigated in medical research, the neutral species of amine-containing compounds diffuse through the cell membrane and further into acidic vesicles present in eukaryotic cells such as protozoa. There they become trapped because diffusion of the positively charged species formed in the acidic vesicles is strongly hindered. We tested our hypothesis with two experiments. First, we studied the distribution of the fluorescent amine acridine orange in activated sludge by confocal fluorescence imaging. We observed intense fluorescence in distinct compartments of the protozoa, but not in the bacterial biomass. Second, we investigated the distribution of 12 amine-containing and eight control micropollutants in both regular activated sludge and sludge where the protozoa had been inactivated. In contrast to most control compounds, the amine-containing micropollutants displayed a distinctly different behavior in the noninhibited sludge compared to the inhibited one: (i) more removal from the liquid phase; (ii) deviation from first-order kinetics for the removal from the liquid phase; and (iii) higher amounts in the solid phase. These results provide strong evidence that ion trapping in protozoa occurs and that it is an important removal mechanism for amine-containing micropollutants in batch experiments with activated sludge that has so far gone unnoticed. We expect that our findings will trigger further investigations on the importance of this process in full-scale wastewater treatment systems, including its relevance for accumulation of ammonium.",15,"
The abstract presents a study investigating the removal of aliphatic amines, a highly abundant class of organic micropollutants, during activated sludge treatment. The authors hypothesize that ion trapping in protozoa, a mechanism previously studied in medical research, contributes to the removal of these amines from the water phase. To test this hypothesis, the authors conducted two experiments: confocal fluorescence imaging to study the distribution of the fluorescent amine acridine orange in activated sludge, and experiments comparing the distribution of amine-containing and control micropollutants in regular activated sludge and sludge where the protozoa had been inactivated. The results provide strong evidence that ion trapping in protozoa is an important removal mechanism for amine-containing micropollutants in activated sludge, as demonstrated by more removal from the liquid phase, deviation from first-order kinetics for the removal from the liquid phase, and higher amounts in the solid phase for the amine-containing micropollutants in noninhibited sludge compared to inhibited sludge. The authors conclude that their findings highlight the importance of this process, which has gone unnoticed in previous studies, and suggest further investigation of its relevance in full-scale wastewater treatment systems, including its role in the accumulation of ammonium.","
The provided abstract focuses on the removal of organic micropollutants, specifically aliphatic amines, during activated sludge treatment. The study explores a novel mechanism, ion trapping in protozoa, which is commonly studied in medical research, for the removal of these micropollutants. The authors hypothesize that this mechanism is partly responsible for the removal of amines from the water phase in activated sludge.

This paper studies how female candidates are covered by newspapers during election campaigns. Previous studies have generally found that the media portray men and women quite similarly, but they have tended to use relatively selective sources and to focus on the amount of coverage and its tone, but not on on its content. We aim to gain a more nuanced understanding of this phenomenon by focusing on the Swiss national elections 2015, relying on an almost comprehensive sample of news items covering most of the duration of the campaign. Our dataset includes about 205,000 documents from 70 sources, covering over 3,900 male and female politicians. We analyze these texts first with a focus on the amount of coverage and second using structural topic models, a natural language processing technique that allows us to identify inductively the themes (topics) of newspaper coverage and, importantly, how the candidates’ gender is linked to both the topics and the language used to discuss them. Results reveal a gender bias in media attention only for non-incumbent candidates. Moreover, some topics, such as the one referring to the election campaign, is discussed more frequently in connection with female candidates, while others, such as topics focusing on personality and political profiles, are more prevalent in articles mentioning men. We uncover no major gender bias in the language used for these topics.",5,"

The roughness of superhydrophobic silicone nanofilaments (SNFs) is exploited to enlarge the contact area of conventional filter material. As an efficient wetting of the filter material is crucial for water treatment, the wettability of SNFs is readily modified from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic during the functionalization process. SNFs are coated on glass beads and subsequently modified with biocidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The enlarged surface area of SNFs allows a 30 times higher loading of AgNPs in comparison to glass beads without SNF coating.

Sustainable HCI can still be considered a relatively young field; yet, it has seen a variety of recent contributions investigating previous approaches and raising questions on how to go forward. As such, the field would greatly benefit from an effort to summarize existing solutions, avoiding reinventing the wheel but also identifying blank spots of missing research. Design patterns offer such an approach. Established in the domain of architecture, successfully utilized to date in software engineering, and having been applied to a variety of areas in HCI, design patterns have a rich history from which the SHCI community can learn and use it to its advantage. We examine previous approaches of design patterns and based on those insights lay out a set of challenges and opportunities for their application to SHCI. As our analysis highlights, patterns can be geared towards recording knowledge or as a tool for outward communication, and given the state of the field, we believe the first objective is the more feasible and more promising starting point.",9,"

Genomewide markers enable us to study genetic differentiation within a species and the factors underlying it at a much higher resolution than before, which advances our understanding of adaptation in organisms. We investigated genomic divergence in Metrosideros polymorpha, a woody species that occupies a wide range of ecological habitats across the Hawaiian Islands and shows remarkable phenotypic variation. Using 1659 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers annotated with the genome assembly, we examined the population genetic structure and demographic history of nine populations across five elevations and two ages of substrates on Mauna Loa, the island of Hawaii. The nine populations were differentiated into two genetic clusters distributed on the lower and higher elevations and were largely admixed on the middle elevation. Demographic modelling revealed that the two genetic clusters have been maintained in the face of gene flow, and the effective population size of the high-altitude cluster was much smaller. A FST -based outlier search among the 1659 SNPs revealed that 34 SNPs (2.05%) were likely to be under divergent selection and the allele frequencies of 21 of them were associated with environmental changes along elevations, such as temperature and precipitation. This study shows a genomic mosaic of M. polymorpha, in which contrasting divergence patterns were found.

The structure of marriage and child-rearing in U.S. households has undergone two marked shifts in the last three decades: a steep decline in the prevalence of marriage among young adults, and a sharp rise in the fraction of children born to unmarried mothers or living in single-headed households. A potential contributor to both phenomena is the declining labor-market opportunities faced by males, which make them less valuable as marital partners. We exploit large scale, plausibly exogenous labor-demand shocks stemming from rising international manufacturing competition to test how shifts in the supply of young ‘marriageable’ males affect marriage, fertility and children's living circumstances. Trade shocks to manufacturing industries have differentially negative impacts on the labor market prospects of men and degrade their marriage-market value along multiple dimensions: diminishing their relative earnings—particularly at the lower segment of the distribution—reducing their physical availability in trade-impacted labor markets, and increasing their participation in risky and damaging behaviors. As predicted by a simple model of marital decision-making under uncertainty, we document that adverse shocks to the supply of `marriageable' men reduce the prevalence of marriage and lower fertility but raise the fraction of children born to young and unwed mothers and living in in poor single-parent households. The falling marriage-market value of young men appears to be a quantitatively important contributor to the rising rate of out-of-wedlock childbearing and single-headed childrearing in the United States.",8,"
The abstract discusses the relationship between labor-market opportunities for men and the declining prevalence of marriage and rising rate of single-parent households in the U.S. It highlights two major shifts in household structure over the last three decades: a decrease in marriage among young adults and an increase in the number of children born to unmarried mothers or living in single-headed households. The authors attribute these phenomena to the declining labor-market opportunities faced by men, which make them less valuable as marital partners. They test the impact of large-scale, exogenous labor-demand shocks stemming from rising international manufacturing competition on marriage, fertility, and children's living circumstances. The authors find that trade shocks negatively affect the labor market prospects of men, reducing their relative earnings, decreasing their physical availability in trade-impacted labor markets, and increasing their participation in risky and damaging behaviors. As a result, these adverse shocks lower the prevalence of marriage and fertility but raise the fraction of children born to young, unwed mothers and living in poor single-parent households, making the falling marriage-market value of young men a quantitatively important contributor to the rising rate of out-of-wedlock childbearing and single-headed childrearing in the U.S.","
The provided abstract relates to several SDGs, particularly SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), and SDG 16 (Peace and Justice Strong Institutions).

SDG 1 (No Poverty) is impacted as the authors suggest that the declining labor-market opportunities faced by men due to international manufacturing competition negatively affects their relative earnings, leading to poverty and financial insecurity. This, in turn, may contribute to the rising rate of single-parent households and out-of-wedlock childbearing, potentially exacerbating poverty and economic instability in affected households.

SDG 5 (Gender Equality) is impacted as the authors also suggest that the declining labor-market opportunities faced by men may make them less valuable as marital partners, potentially contributing to a decrease in marriage and an increase in single-parent households. This may result in women bearing the brunt of household responsibilities and financial instability, potentially perpetuating gender inequalities and limiting opportunities for women's economic and social advancement.

SDG 16 (Peace and Justice Strong Institutions) is impacted as the authors argue that the falling marriage-market value of young men may contribute to risky and damaging behaviors, potentially leading to social and economic instability. This may have broader implications for community safety, social cohesion, and the functioning of institutions at all levels.

While the abstract does not explicitly address other SDGs, it does touch on related issues, such as the impact of trade shocks on the physical availability of men, potentially contributing to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by affecting migration patterns and urbanization. The rising rate of single-parent households may also impact SDG 1 (No Poverty) by potentially limiting economic opportunities and increasing the burden of financial instability on women and children.

Overall, the abstract highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay between labor-market opportunities, household structure, and broader social and economic outcomes, with implications for SDGs related to poverty, gender equality, social and economic instability, and urbanization.","
SDG 5: Gender Equality

The abstract highlights the declining prevalence of marriage and rising rate of single-parent households among young adults, particularly among men. This trend suggests a decrease in the economic and social value of men as marital partners, which could lead to unequal gender outcomes. However, the authors argue that the declining marriage-market value of men is a contributing factor to the rising rate of single-parent households and out-of-wedlock childbearing. This suggests that policies aimed at addressing gender equality and reducing the economic and social inequality between men and women should also consider the impact of declining labor-market opportunities on men's marriage-market value and the resulting household dynamics.

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The abstract identifies the declining labor-market opportunities faced by men as a significant contributor to the declining marriage-market value of men. This highlights the importance of decent work and economic growth in ensuring that men are able to secure employment and earn a living wage. Policies aimed at promoting economic growth and creating decent work opportunities for men should also consider their impact on marriage-market value and household dynamics.

SDG 15: Life on Land

While the abstract does not directly address SDG 15, it does highlight the impact of rising international manufacturing competition on labor-market opportunities for men. This could have implications for land use and resource management, as men may be more likely to migrate to urban areas in search of employment opportunities.

Based on the insights, the following SDGs are contributed to by the abstract:

1. SDG 1 - No Poverty: The declining labor-market opportunities for men due to international manufacturing competition can lead to poverty, as the authors suggest that the falling marriage-market value of young men appears to be a quantitatively important contributor to the rising rate of out-of-wedlock childbearing and single-headed childrearing in the United States. Policies aimed at addressing poverty should consider the impact of declining labor-market opportunities on men's marriage-market value and the resulting household dynamics.

2. SDG 5 - Gender Equality: The authors find that declining labor-market opportunities for men negatively affects men's marriage-market value, leading to a decrease in marriage and an increase in single-parent households. This trend highlights the importance of gender equality and promoting women's economic independence, as it can mitigate the negative impacts of declining labor-market opportunities on household dynamics.

3. SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The impact of declining labor-market opportunities on household dynamics has implications for social and economic instability, as it can contribute to poverty, inequality, and social unrest. Policies promoting economic growth and creating decent work opportunities for men should be implemented while considering their impact on household dynamics and social stability.

It is important to note that while the authors suggest that labor-market opportunities may impact migration patterns and land use, this does not directly contribute to SDG 15 - Life on Land. However, sustainable land use and resource management should be considered in this context, as declining labor-market opportunities may lead to land-use changes and migration patterns that impact the environment. Therefore, policies promoting sustainable land use and resource management should be implemented while considering the impact of declining labor-market opportunities on household dynamics and the environment.

In summary, based on the insights, the abstract contributes to SDG 1, SDG 5, and SDG 16, while highlighting the importance of considering the impact of declining labor-market opportunities on household dynamics and the environment in the context of sustainable land use and resource management. There is no direct contribution to SDG 15, but it is an important consideration in this context.","

Conventional tillage is a widespread soil management practice that controls weeds and promotes nutrient mineralization at the expense of a degraded soil structure and soil carbon (C) loss. Although C dynamics and soil structure are widely recognized as pivotal to essential environmental and crop-related agroecosystem processes such as belowground C storage and crop root establishment, there is still a need to evaluate cropping practices most favorable for soil structure. For example, the effects on soil structure by continuous intensive tillage after a ley period remains unclear. To address these issues, we measured mean weight diameter, total C and total nitrogen (N) in whole soil and water-stable aggregate fractions after a 4-year arable crop rotation on a Cambisol where organic and conventional management was combined with intensive tillage and different types of conservation tillage. Measurements were repeated following a 2-year grass-clover ley period. Results showed that 4 years of organic management (including the application of cattle manure slurry) combined with reduced tillage significantly improved soil structure through increasing the proportion of large macroaggregates and hence the aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) in the 0-6 cm soil layer. Although an increase in MWD after ley was observed in organic intensive tillage and a marginal increase in conventional intensive tillage, a significant increase in total C was observed only for the organic cropping systems, which also showed a high C stratification between 0-6 cm and 6-20 cm depth. Thus, a ley period enhances soil structure after continuous cropping under intensive tillage and when organic management is combined with reduced tillage. In conclusion, soil structure is best maintained when combining organic management with reduced tillage due to additive effects.",2,"

While an increase in MWD after ley was observed in organic intensive tillage and conventional intensive tillage, a significant increase in total C was observed only for organic cropping systems, which also showed a high C stratification between 0-6 cm and 6-20 cm depth. The study concludes that a ley period enhances soil structure after continuous cropping under intensive tillage, and the best maintenance of soil structure is achieved by combining organic management with reduced tillage due to additive effects.","
The provided abstract relates to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2, SDG 12, and SDG 15. 

SDG 2 - Zero Hunger: The study highlights the importance of soil structure in promoting sustainable agriculture, as it directly impacts crop root establishment and the availability of nutrients for plant growth. Adequate soil structure also contributes to better water-holding capacity, which is crucial for drought-prone areas. By improving soil structure through organic crop management and conservation tillage, the study helps to achieve SDG 2 by enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting food security.

SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production: The study's focus on reducing soil carbon (C) loss through sustainable soil management practices contributes to SDG 12 by promoting responsible resource consumption and production. Sustainable soil management helps to conserve soil organic carbon, which plays a significant role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Organic management practices such as the application of cattle manure slurry also promote the cycling of nutrients within agricultural systems, which reduces the use of synthetic fertilizers and contributes to more responsible resource consumption.

SDG 15 - Life on Land: The study's focus on soil structure and its impact on terrestrial ecosystems is directly related to SDG 15. Improved soil structure leads to increased soil aggregation, which enhances water retention, decreases soil erosion, and improves soil fertility. These outcomes contribute to the protection and restoration of terrestrial ecosystems, which is a key component of SDG 15. By promoting sustainable soil management practices, the study also helps to halt biodiversity loss and promote ecosystem resilience, which are crucial aspects of achieving SDG 15.

In conclusion, the study's focus on improving soil structure through sustainable soil management practices contributes to multiple SDGs, including SDG 2, SDG 12, and SDG 15. By promoting responsible resource consumption and production, enhancing agricultural productivity, and promoting terrestrial ecosystem protection and restoration, the study helps to achieve multiple SDGs simultaneously.","
SDG 2: Zero Hunger
Improving soil structure through organic crop management, conservation tillage, and grass-clover leys has the potential to contribute to SDG 2 by increasing crop yield and reducing hunger. Soil structure plays a crucial role in crop root establishment, which affects crop growth and yield. The study showed that organic management combined with reduced tillage significantly improves soil structure by increasing the proportion of large macroaggregates and hence the aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) in the 0-6 cm soil layer. This improved soil structure can lead to better crop root establishment, which ultimately results in higher crop yield and reduced hunger.

SDG 13: Climate Action
SDG 13 aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. The study demonstrated that organic management combined with reduced tillage enhances soil structure, which can lead to higher carbon sequestration. This is because organic management increased total C in the soil, which can be stored in large macroaggregates. Carbon sequestration helps to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change by reducing the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere.

SDG 15: Life on Land
SDG 15 aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and habitat loss. The study showed that a ley period enhances soil structure after continuous cropping under intensive tillage. Grass-clover leys are a form of conservation agriculture, which can promote soil structure by increasing the organic matter content, thereby reducing land degradation and habitat loss. This aligns with SDG 15, as it aims to promote sustainable land use and management practices.

In summary, the study's findings contribute to SDGs 2, 13, and 15 by highlighting the potential of organic crop management, conservation tillage, and grass-clover leys to improve soil structure, which ultimately results in higher crop yield, carbon sequestration, and sustainable land use and management practices.","

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether parental feeding practices, such as pressure to eat, permitting unhealthy food, and restriction of unhealthy food predict children's body mass index (BMI) percentile or if children's BMI percentiles predict parental feeding practices.

DESIGN: Longitudinal data were collected among 526 dyads of children (6-11 years old) and one of their parents. Parents reported parental feeding practices, restriction of unhealthy food, permission of unhealthy food, and pressure to eat. Children's weight and height were assessed objectively. All measurements were conducted twice with a time lag of 10 months.

RESULTS: Cross-lagged panel analyses demonstrated that low levels of children's BMI percentiles (measured at the baseline) predicted parental feeding practices (measured at the follow-up) but not vice versa. Only one effect suggesting bi-directionality was found, with parental restriction of unhealthy food preceding higher levels of children's BMI percentiles at the follow-up.

Summary
1. Current approaches to conservation may be inadequate to maintain ecosystem integrity because they are mostly based on rarity status of organisms rather than functional signifi- cance. Alternatively, approaches focusing on the protection of ecological networks lead to more appropriate conservation targets to maintain ecosystem integrity.
2. We propose that a shift in focus from species to interaction networks is necessary to achieve pressing conservation management and restoration ecology goals of conserving biodi- versity, ecosystem processes and ultimately landscape-scale delivery of ecosystem services.
3. Using topical examples from the literature, we discuss historical and conceptual advances, current challenges and ways to move forward. We also propose a road map to ecological net- work conservation, providing a novel ready to use approach to identify clear conservation targets with flexible data requirements.
4. Synthesis and applications.

The study raises questions about the potential benefits and harms of saving more, as participants in the study borrow at 90% APR.","
From the provided abstract and core themes, it is clear that this study relates to SDG 1 - No Poverty and SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth. The study's focus on microcredit clients highlights the importance of financial inclusion and access to credit for individuals living in poverty. The impact of the peer group program on savings also aligns with SDG 8, as it promotes economic growth through increased savings and financial stability. The study's findings about the effectiveness of non-financial rewards and feedback text messages offer insights into innovative ways to promote financial literacy and responsible borrowing. The study's discussion of the potential benefits and harms of saving more is also relevant to SDG 1, as it speaks to the need for individuals to manage their debt and build financial resilience in the face of high-interest rates. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the role of financial inclusion and literacy in promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty.","
SDG 1: Poverty Eradication
The study's results indicate that the Savings Group Treatment significantly increases savings for microcredit clients, with the number of deposits growing 3.7-fold and the average balance almost doubling. This suggests that the program could help clients manage their finances more effectively, reducing the likelihood of falling into poverty due to unexpected expenses or emergencies. Additionally, the fact that the program appears to be particularly beneficial for those at the top of the distribution could suggest that it may help to narrow income inequality and promote upward mobility.

SDG 5: Gender Equality
The study does not explicitly address gender equality, but it does not appear to have a gendered impact on savings. The authors note that the Savings Group Treatment is not explicitly targeted at women, and the study does not report any significant differences in savings between men and women. However, given the importance of financial literacy and management for women's economic opportunities and security, further research is needed to determine whether the Savings Group Treatment could be a particularly effective tool for promoting financial inclusion and empowerment among women.

SDG 15: Life on Land
This SDG may seem like an unlikely fit for a study on microcredit clients' savings, but the study does provide insights into the importance of financial management for sustainable land use practices. For example, clients with more savings may be better equipped to invest in sustainable agriculture practices, such as conservation agriculture or agroforestry, which can promote soil health, water management, and tree planting. Additionally, having access to savings can enable clients to better manage land use and resource allocation in times of drought or other climate-related shocks, which can reduce the risk of land degradation and desertification.

In terms of relevance to each SDG, SDG 1 appears to have the strongest connection, followed by SDG 15. SDG 5 is less directly related, but further research is needed to determine whether the Savings Group Treatment could be a particularly effective tool for promoting financial inclusion and empowerment among women.","
The study presented in the abstract provides valuable insights into promoting financial inclusion and literacy, particularly for individuals living in poverty. The Savings Group Treatment, which combines public goal setting, monitoring, and non-financial rewards, significantly increases savings among microcredit clients, indicating its potential to help clients manage their finances more effectively and reduce the likelihood of falling into poverty due to unexpected expenses or emergencies. The study's findings also suggest that the program may help to narrow income inequality and promote upward mobility. While the study does not explicitly address gender equality, further research is needed to determine whether the Savings Group Treatment could be a particularly effective tool for promoting financial inclusion and empowerment among women.

Overall, the study's results align with SDG 1 - No Poverty and SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, with potential implications for SDG 5 - Gender Equality and SDG 15 - Life on Land.","
Based on the insights, the contributions of the abstract towards the SDGs are:

1. SDG 1 - No Poverty: The Savings Group Treatment significantly increases savings among microcredit clients, which can help them manage their finances more effectively and reduce the likelihood of falling into poverty due to unexpected expenses or emergencies. This contributes directly to SDG 1.

2. SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth: By increasing savings, the Savings Group Treatment can also promote upward mobility, as participants have more resources to invest in business opportunities or pursue education and training that can lead to better-paying jobs. This aligns with SDG 8.

3. SDG 5 - Gender Equality: While the study does not explicitly address gender equality, further research is needed to determine whether the Savings Group Treatment could be a particularly effective tool for promoting financial inclusion and empowerment among women. This speaks to the importance of gender equality in promoting financial literacy and inclusion, as women often face greater financial barriers due to cultural and societal norms. However, because the study did not specifically address gender equality, it cannot be ranked as highly as SDGs 1 and 8.

4. SDG 15 - Life on Land: The study's findings suggest that the Savings Group Treatment could also contribute to SDG 15, as savings can provide a buffer against climate-related shocks and reduce the risk of land degradation and desertification. This is particularly relevant in areas where droughts, floods, and other climate-related events can wreak havoc on agricultural lands and lead to poverty and migration. However, because the study did not focus explicitly on SDG 15, it cannot be ranked as highly as SDGs 1, 8, and 5.

Understanding factors that increase ecosystem stability is critical in the face of environmental change. Biodiversity plays a key role in buffering ecosystems against disturbances such as extreme climatic events. The evolution of biological communities within their local environment may also increase ecosystem stability and resilience, but this has yet to be tested. Here, we provide evidence for such evolutionary effects using a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment. Communities of plants with a history of co-occurrence (co-selected communities) were temporally more stable at low diversity than the same communities of plants with no such history (naïve communities). Furthermore, co-selected communities exhibited greater recovery following a major flood, resulting in more stable post-flood productivity. These results demonstrate that community evolution can increase ecosystem stability under normal circumstances and in response to extreme disturbance, but also suggest that high diversity can in part compensate for evolutionary naïvety.",15,"
The abstract ""Evolution increases ecosystem temporal stability and recovery from a flood in grassland communities"" highlights two main themes: the impact of biodiversity and community evolution on ecosystem stability, particularly in response to extreme disturbances. The authors test this hypothesis using a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment, where they compare the temporal stability and recovery from a flood between co-selected communities (with a history of co-occurrence) and naïve communities (with no such history). The results suggest that co-selected communities exhibit greater temporal stability at low diversity and exhibit greater recovery following a major flood, resulting in more stable post-flood productivity. The authors conclude that community evolution can increase ecosystem stability under normal circumstances and in response to extreme disturbance, but also suggest that high diversity can compensate for evolutionary naïvety.

This abstract sheds light on the relationship between biodiversity, community evolution, and ecosystem stability, particularly in response to extreme disturbances. The findings suggest that co-selected communities, which have a history of co-occurrence, exhibit greater temporal stability at low diversity and more stable post-flood productivity than naïve communities with no such history. This indicates that community evolution can increase ecosystem stability under normal circumstances and in response to extreme disturbances like floods. The study highlights the importance of understanding factors that enhance ecosystem resilience, which is crucial in the face of environmental change. These results have implications for achieving SDGs related to sustainable land use, such as SDG 15 - Life on Land, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, and SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities, which aims to make human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. By increasing ecosystem stability and resilience through community evolution, we can better prepare for and respond to extreme disturbances, which is a key element of sustainable land use and urban development. Furthermore, the study suggests that high diversity can compensate for evolutionary naïvety, which could inform strategies for achieving SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, which aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. By promoting the co-evolution of biological communities, we can increase ecosystem stability and resilience, which in turn could lead to more sustainable and efficient resource use. Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding community evolution in achieving sustainable development goals related to land use and urban development, and underscores the need for further research in this area.","

Brucellosis is a widespread zoonotic disease considered as an emerging and re-emerging disease with a resulting threat of public health and animal health. Official reports document an animal incidence in Kazakhstan of about 0.6% per year, and the country still registers high number of human cases annually . The main objective of this paper was to evaluate the distribution and economic impact of brucellosis in Kazakhstan. We analysed human disease incidence data obtained from the Government Sanitary & Epidemiological Service with the aim to estimate the burden of disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We also estimated the economic impact in terms of monetary losses. Additionally, we mapped the geographical distribution of the disease throughout Kazakhstan. In total, 1,334 human cases of brucellosis were registered in 2015 in Kazakhstan that resulted in 713 DALYs. Around US Dollar 21 million was spent on compensation for animals that had to be slaughtered due to brucellosis, and an additional US Dollar 24 million was spent on testing animals. Animal brucellosis and human brucellosis occur throughout the whole country, some trends of which are reviewed in this paper. We estimated the burden of the disease and explored possible explanation for high human incidence rates. This paper is the first to estimate the human burden of disease and the economic costs in Kazakhstan. Both of these are substantial.",3,"

Plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning can potentially interact with global climate by altering fluxes of the radiatively active trace gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). We studied the effects of grassland species richness (1-16) in combination with application of fertilizer (nitrogen:phosphorus:potassium = 100:43.6:83 kg ha(-1) a(-1)) on N2O and CH4 fluxes in a long-term field experiment. Soil N2O emissions, measured over 2 years using static chambers, decreased with species richness unless fertilizer was added. N2O emissions increased with fertilization and the fraction of legumes in plant communities. Soil CH4 uptake, a process driven by methanotrophic bacteria, decreased with plant species numbers, irrespective of fertilization. Using structural equation models, we related trace gas fluxes to soil moisture, soil inorganic N concentrations, nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activity, and the abundance of ammonia oxidizers, nitrite oxidizers, and denitrifiers (quantified by real-time PCR of gene fragments amplified from microbial DNA in soil). These analyses indicated that plant species richness increased soil moisture, which in turn increased N cycling-related activities. Enhanced N cycling increased N2O emission and soil CH4 uptake, with the latter possibly caused by removal of inhibitory ammonium by nitrification. The moisture-related indirect effects were surpassed by direct, moisture-independent effects opposite in direction. Microbial gene abundances responded positively to fertilizer but not to plant species richness. The response patterns we found were statistically robust and highlight the potential of plant biodiversity to interact with climatic change through mechanisms unrelated to carbon storage and associated carbon dioxide removal.",13,"
The abstract investigates the impact of plant species diversity on soil emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), two potent greenhouse gases. The study, conducted in a grassland ecosystem, found that higher species richness generally led to lower N2O emissions, except when fertilizer was applied. In contrast, CH4 uptake decreased with increasing plant species numbers, irrespective of fertilization. The analysis revealed that higher species richness increased soil moisture, leading to enhanced N cycling-related activities and N2O emissions, as well as increased soil CH4 uptake, potentially due to removal of inhibitory ammonium by nitrification. These effects were surpassed by direct, moisture-independent effects opposite in direction. The study highlights the potential of plant biodiversity to interact with climatic change through mechanisms unrelated to carbon storage and associated carbon dioxide removal, and suggests that plant species richness increases soil moisture, which in turn increases N cycling-related activities.

The provided abstract sheds light on the relationship between plant species diversity and soil emissions of two potent greenhouse gases, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). This study's findings have implications for several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land).

Firstly, the study highlights the potential of plant biodiversity to interact with climatic change through mechanisms unrelated to carbon storage and associated carbon dioxide removal. This underscores the importance of preserving and promoting plant species richness in ecosystems as a strategy to mitigate climate change. SDG 13 seeks to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, and promoting plant species richness could contribute to this goal.

Secondly, the study reveals that higher species richness generally leads to lower N2O emissions, except when fertilizer is applied. This finding suggests that plant species diversity could help to reduce N2O emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, which contributes to global warming. Reducing N2O emissions is critical for achieving SDG 13, as N2O is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions.

Thirdly, the study reveals that higher species richness increases soil moisture, leading to enhanced N cycling-related activities. Enhanced N cycling, in turn, increases N2O emissions and soil CH4 uptake, potentially due to removal of inhibitory ammonium by nitrification. While CH4 uptake decreased with increasing plant species numbers, irrespective of fertilization, the study suggests that plant species richness increases soil moisture, leading to enhanced N cycling-related activities, and this could contribute to achieving SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.

Lastly, the study highlights the need to consider the impact of plant species diversity on soil emissions of greenhouse gases in the context of climate change. This underscores the importance of promoting plant species richness as a strategy to mitigate climate change, which is critical for achieving SDG 13.

SDG 13: Climate Action
The abstract discusses the effects of plant species diversity on soil emissions of methane and nitrous oxide, both potent greenhouse gases. The study found that higher species richness generally led to lower N2O emissions, except when fertilizer was applied. These results highlight the potential of plant biodiversity to mitigate climate change through mechanisms unrelated to carbon storage and associated carbon dioxide removal. Therefore, SDG 13, which aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, is directly relevant to this study.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The study investigated the impact of plant species diversity on soil emissions of methane and nitrous oxide in a grassland ecosystem. The analysis revealed that higher species richness increased soil moisture, which in turn increased N cycling-related activities. These findings emphasize the importance of considering the impact of plant species diversity on soil emissions of greenhouse gases in the context of sustainable land use and conservation practices, which align with SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and mountains, and combat desertification, land degradation, and deforestation.

Note: While SDG 14, which aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources, does not appear to be directly relevant based on the abstract's content, it is worth mentioning that the study's findings regarding the impact of plant species diversity on soil emissions of greenhouse gases can also have implications for coastal ecosystems, where soil emissions of greenhouse gases can contribute to sea level rise and coastal erosion, which are major challenges for the sustainable use and management of coastal ecosystems. As such, SDG 14 should not be entirely excluded from the SDGs to check list.

In summary, this study's findings are directly relevant to SDGs 13 and 15, and its implications for SDG 14 should also be considered.","
The study's findings highlight the importance of promoting plant species richness in mitigating climate change and achieving SDGs 13 and 15. Higher species richness generally leads to lower N2O emissions, except when fertilizer is applied, suggesting that plant biodiversity could contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change (SDG 13).

Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (B.g. tritici) is the causal agent of the wheat powdery mildew disease. The highly fragmented B.g. tritici genome available so far has prevented a systematic analysis of effector genes that are known to be involved in host adaptation. To study the diversity and evolution of effector genes we produced a chromosome‐scale assembly of the B.g. tritici genome.  The genome assembly and annotation was achieved by combining long‐read sequencing with high‐density genetic mapping, bacterial artificial chromosome fingerprinting and transcriptomics. We found that the 166.6 Mb B.g. tritici genome encodes 844 candidate effector genes, over 40% more than previously reported. Candidate effector genes have characteristic local genomic organization such as gene clustering and enrichment for recombination‐active regions and certain transposable element families. A large group of 412 candidate effector genes shows high plasticity in terms of copy number variation in a global set of 36 isolates and of transcription levels.  Our data suggest that copy number variation and transcriptional flexibility are the main drivers for adaptation in B.g. tritici. The high repeat content may play a role in providing a genomic environment that allows rapid evolution of effector genes with selection as the driving force.",2,"

International survey datasets are analyzed with increasing frequency to investigate and compare attitudes toward immigration and to examine the contextual factors that shape these attitudes. However, international comparisons of abstract, psychological constructs require the measurements to be equivalent–i.e., they should measure the same concept on the same measurement scale. Traditional approaches to assessing measurement equivalence quite often
lead to the conclusion that measurements are cross-nationally incomparable but have been criticized for being overly strict. In the current study, we present an alternative Bayesian approach that assesses whether measurements are approximately (rather than exactly)
equivalent. This approach allows small variations in measurement parameters across groups.
Taking a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis framework as a starting point, this study applies approximate and exact equivalence tests to the anti-immigration attitudes scale that was implemented in the European Social Survey (ESS). Measurement equivalence is tested across the full set of 271,220 individuals in 35 ESS countries over six rounds. The results of the exact and the approximate approaches are quite different. Approximate scalar measurement equivalence is established in all ESS rounds, thus allowing researchers to meaningfully compare these mean scores and their relationships with other theoretical constructs of interest. The exact approach, however, eventually proves to be overly strict and leads to the conclusion that measurements are incomparable for a large number of countries and time points.",10,"

We examine the differential effects of family disadvantage on the education and adult labor market outcomes of men and women using high-quality administrative data on the entire population of Denmark born between 1966 and 1995. We link parental education and family structure during childhood to male–female and brother–sister differences in adolescent outcomes, educational attainment, and adult earnings and employment. Our results are consistent with U.S. findings that boys benefit more from an advantageous family environment than do girls in terms of grade-school outcomes. Father’s education, which has not been examined in previous studies, is particularly important for sons. However, we find a very different pattern of parental influence on adult outcomes. Gender gaps in educational attainment, employment, and earnings are increasing in maternal education, benefiting daughters. Paternal education decreases the gender gaps in educational attainment (favoring sons) and labor market outcomes (favoring daughters).

Biodiversity enhances ecosystem functions such as biomass production and nutrient cycling. Although the majority of the terrestrial biodiversity is hidden in soils, very little is known about the importance of the diversity of microbial communities for soil functioning. Here, we tested effects of biodiversity on the functioning of methanotrophs, a specialized group of soil bacteria that plays a key role in mediating greenhouse gas emissions from soils. Using pure strains of methanotrophic bacteria, we assembled artificial communities of different diversity levels, with which we inoculated sterile soil microcosms. To assess the functioning of these communities, we measured methane oxidation by gas chromatography throughout the experiment and determined changes in community composition and community size at several time points by quantitative PCR and sequencing. We demonstrate that microbial diversity had a positive overyielding effect on methane oxidation, in particular at the beginning of the experiment. This higher assimilation of CH4 at high diversity translated into increased growth and significantly larger communities towards the end of the study. The overyielding of mixtures with respect to CH4 consumption and community size were positively correlated. The temporal CH4 consumption profiles of strain monocultures differed, raising the possibility that temporal complementarity of component strains drove the observed community-level strain richness effects; however, the community niche metric we derived from the temporal activity profiles did not explain the observed strain richness effect. The strain richness effect also was unrelated to both the phylogenetic and functional trait diversity of mixed communities. Overall, our results suggest that positive biodiversity–ecosystem-function relationships show similar patterns across different scales and may be widespread in nature.

Are Islamic banks inherently more stable than conventional banks? We address this question by applying a survival analysis based on the Cox proportional hazard model to a comprehensive sample of 421 banks in 20 Middle and Far Eastern countries from 1995 to 2010. By comparing the failure risk for both bank types, we find that Islamic banks have a significantly lower risk of failure than that of their conventional peers. This lower risk is based both unconditionally and conditionally on bank-specific (microeconomic) variables as well as macroeconomic and market structure variables. Our findings indicate that the design and implementation of early warning systems for bank failure should recognize the distinct risk profiles of the two bank types.",10,"

56,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:159261,"Application of Environmental DNA Metabarcoding for Predicting Anthropogenic Pollution in Rivers
Rivers are among the most threatened freshwater ecosystems, and anthropogenic activities are affecting both river structures and water quality. While assessing the organisms can provide a comprehensive measure of a river’s ecological status, it is limited by the traditional morphotaxonomy-based biomonitoring. Recent advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding allow to identify prokaryotes and eukaryotes in one sequencing run, and could thus allow unprecedented resolution. Whether such eDNA-based data can be used directly to predict the pollution status of rivers as a complementation of environmental data remains unknown. Here we used eDNA metabarcoding to explore the main stressors of rivers along which community structure changes, and to identify the method’s potential for predicting pollution status based on eDNA data. We showed that a broad range of taxa in bacterial, protistan, and metazoan communities could be profiled with eDNA. Nutrients were the main driving stressor affecting communities’ structure, alpha diversity, and the ecological network. We specifically observed that the relative abundance of indicative OTUs was significantly correlated with nutrient levels. These OTUs data could be used to predict the nutrient status up to 79% accuracy on testing data sets. Thus, our study gives a novel approach to predicting the pollution status of rivers by eDNA data.",14,"

Lake Orta experienced for a few decades a unique history of chronic pollution, with extreme changes in pH and copper concentration. Currently, the lake has recovered to its almost pristine oligotrophic conditions, but its sediments still preserve the record of all the changes that happened since the establishment of the first polluting factories in the 1920s, through to the liming activities in 1989-1990, and to the recovery phase that is still going on. Here we review the current knowledge for Lake Orta regarding rotifers, a diverse component of the zooplankton of the lake, through studies on living organisms and on their resting stages accumulated in the sediments. We also report a brief review of what is known in general on the effects of changes in pH and copper concentration on rotifers at the population, species and community level, providing expectations for such effects on the rotifers of Lake Orta. Then, we conclude our review with a perspective on the potential use of rotifers hatched from the resting stages in the sediment of Lake Orta with the description of experiments that can be performed in the future in the framework of resurrection ecology, in order to understand the mechanisms of past and future changes in the environment.",14,"
The abstract proposes Lake Orta as a model system for studying the ecological and evolutionary impacts of environmental change on rotifers, a type of zooplankton. The lake has experienced chronic pollution in the past, resulting in extreme changes in pH and copper concentration. Despite recovery to oligotrophic conditions, sediments still preserve a record of these changes. The review discusses existing knowledge on rotifers in Lake Orta, obtained through studies on both living organisms and sediment resting stages. It also provides a general overview of the effects of changes in pH and copper concentration on rotifers at population, species, and community levels. The review concludes by suggesting that future experiments in the framework of resurrection ecology, using rotifers hatched from sediment resting stages, can shed light on the mechanisms of past and future environmental changes.","
This abstract highlights potential impacts on SDG 15 - Life on Land and SDG 13 - Climate Action, as the review discusses the ecological and evolutionary impacts of environmental change on rotifers, a type of zooplankton, in Lake Orta. Lake Orta has experienced extreme changes in pH and copper concentration due to chronic pollution, which has led to changes in the rotifer community. However, the lake has since recovered to oligotrophic conditions, and sediment resting stages still preserve a record of these changes. The review suggests that future experiments using resurrection ecology, which involves hatching rotifers from sediment resting stages, can provide insights into the mechanisms of past and future environmental changes. This research can contribute to a better understanding of how environmental changes impact aquatic ecosystems and inform strategies for sustainable management of water resources, in line with SDG 13. Additionally, the sediment record can provide valuable information about the effects of past environmental changes on aquatic ecosystems, which can inform adaptation and mitigation strategies in the context of climate change, in line with SDG 15.","
SDG 14: Life below water
The abstract mentions the study of rotifers, a type of zooplankton, in Lake Orta. Rotifers are a diverse component of the lake's ecosystem, and their behavior and distribution have been influenced by environmental changes. Therefore, studying these organisms can contribute to our understanding of the ecological impacts of pollution and liming activities on aquatic ecosystems, aligning with SDG 14.

SDG 15: Life on land
Although the abstract focuses on Lake Orta, which is an aquatic ecosystem, the review also mentions the sediment resting stages of rotifers, which can provide insights into the past environmental conditions of the lake. This information could help inform future conservation and management strategies, which aligns with SDG 15's goal to conserve and sustainably use terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

Overall, the abstract highlights the potential value of studying rotifers in Lake Orta for both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, making it relevant to SDGs 14 and 15.","

It rejects the claim that the beneficial role of moral philosophy is due to moral philosophers’ expertise which allows them to provide the public with the right answers to moral questions. Instead, it holds that the benefits are to be found elsewhere. Moral experts, the paper argues, differ from experts on non-normative issues. One should not act on the judgements of moral philosophers. This is not because moral philosophers are unlikely to get it right in moral matters, but because one only has reasons to follow their judgements if one has a moral understanding of the practical issues in question. And in this respect, it is argued, moral philosophy can indeed serve a public interest, namely by improving people’s moral understanding.",16,"
This abstract explores the question of whether moral philosophy serves public interest. The paper argues that moral philosophy does, but not for the commonly proposed reasons. It rejects the notion that moral experts have unique expertise that enables them to provide accurate moral answers for the public. Instead, the paper suggests that the benefits of moral philosophy lie elsewhere. Unlike experts on non-moral issues, people should not necessarily follow the judgements of moral philosophers as they only have reasons to do so if they share a similar moral understanding of the practical issues at hand. Therefore, moral philosophy can indeed serve a public interest by improving people's moral understanding.","
The provided abstract touches upon sustainable development through its exploration of public interest and the role of moral philosophy in serving it.

The peritraumatic cognitive process of mental defeat, the complete loss of inner resistance, has been identified as a key predictor of PTSD. Yet, most evidence on cognitive risk factors stems from industrialized countries where survivors typically report few traumata. Research from postconflict settings indicates that individual differences decrease with accumulating traumatic experiences, as almost everybody develops PTSD at extreme levels of trauma load. Would this leave less room for the impact of cognitive processes? In a sample of 227 Ugandan rebel war survivors, we investigated whether mental defeat influences trauma-related psychopathology in regression models accounting for cumulative trauma exposure. We found strong main effects of mental defeat on lifetime PTSD risk, current PTSD severity and dissociative symptoms, but no mental defeat × trauma load interaction effects. Our results indicate that peritraumatic mental defeat is central to understand individual differences in psychological reactions after single traumatic events as well as multiple traumatization.",16,"

BACKGROUND  Transmaternal exposure to tobacco, microbes, nutrients, and other environmental factors shapes the fetal immune system through epigenetic processes. The gastric microbe Helicobacter pylori represents an ancestral constituent of the human microbiota that causes gastric disorders on the one hand and is inversely associated with allergies and chronic inflammatory conditions on the other.  OBJECTIVE  Here we investigate the consequences of transmaternal exposure to H pylori in utero and/or during lactation for susceptibility to viral and bacterial infection, predisposition to allergic airway inflammation, and development of immune cell populations in the lungs and lymphoid organs.  METHODS  We use experimental models of house dust mite- or ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation and influenza A virus or Citrobacter rodentium infection along with metagenomics analyses, multicolor flow cytometry, and bisulfite pyrosequencing, to study the effects of H pylori on allergy severity and immunologic and microbiome correlates thereof.  RESULTS  Perinatal exposure to H pylori extract or its immunomodulator vacuolating cytotoxin confers robust protective effects against allergic airway inflammation not only in first- but also second-generation offspring but does not increase susceptibility to viral or bacterial infection. Immune correlates of allergy protection include skewing of regulatory over effector T cells, expansion of regulatory T-cell subsets expressing CXCR3 or retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt, and demethylation of the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) locus. The composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota is measurably affected by perinatal H pylori exposure.  CONCLUSION  We conclude that exposure to H pylori has consequences not only for the carrier but also for subsequent generations that can be exploited for interventional purposes.",3,"

63,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170833,"The evolution of daily food sharing: A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis
Some human subsistence economies are characterized by extensive daily food sharing networks, which may buffer the risk of shortfalls and facilitate cooperative production and divisions of labor among households. Comparative studies of human food sharing can assess the generalizability of this theory across time, space, and diverse lifeways. Here we test several predictions about daily sharing norms–which presumably reflect realized cooperative behavior–in a globally representative sample of nonindustrial societies (the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample), while controlling for multiple sources of autocorrelation among societies using Bayesian multilevel models. Consistent with a risk-buffering function, we find that sharing is less likely in societies with alternative means of smoothing production and consumption such as animal husbandry, food storage, and external trade. Further, food sharing was tightly linked to labor sharing, indicating gains to cooperative production and perhaps divisions of labor. We found a small phylogenetic signal for food sharing (captured by a supertree of human populations based on genetic and linguistic data) that was mediated by food storage and social stratification. Food sharing norms reliably emerge as part of cooperative economies across time and space but are culled by innovations that facilitate self-reliant production.",2,"

This abstract focuses on the topic of daily food sharing networks and their relationship with cooperative production and risk buffering. It highlights the importance of comparative studies of human food sharing across time, space, and diverse lifeways, using Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to control for multiple sources of autocorrelation among societies. The findings suggest that daily food sharing networks are more prevalent in societies where alternative means of smoothing production and consumption are not available, and that food and labor sharing are tightly linked. The study also reveals a phylogenetic signal for food sharing mediated by food storage and social stratification, and concludes that food sharing norms reliably emerge as part of cooperative economies across time and space, but are culled by innovations facilitating self-reliant production. These findings have implications for SDGs related to poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, industry, innovation, infrastructure, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water, life on land, and partnerships for the goals. Specifically, daily food sharing networks may contribute to reducing poverty and hunger (SDGs 1 and 2) by buffering the risk of shortfalls and facilitating cooperative production and divisions of labor among households. They may also promote gender equality (SDG 5) by linking food and labor sharing. The study's focus on the role of food storage and social stratification in shaping daily food sharing norms sheds light on the relationship between food, water, and sanitation (SDGs 6 and 6.3), as well as the importance of industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9) in promoting sustainable food systems. The study's findings also suggest that innovations facilitating self-reliant production (SDG 8) may lead to the culling of daily food sharing networks, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to sustainable development that balances self-reliance with cooperative production and risk buffering.

Reducing maternal and child mortality is a priority in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and will likely remain so after 2015. Evidence exists on the investments, interventions and enabling policies required. Less is understood about why some countries achieve faster progress than other comparable countries. The Success Factors for Women’s and Children’s Health studies sought to address this knowledge gap using statistical and econometric analyses of data from 144 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) over 20 years; Boolean, qualitative comparative analysis; a literature review; and country-specific reviews in 10 fast-track countries for MDGs 4 and 5a. There is no standard formula – fast-track countries deploy tailored strategies and adapt quickly to change. However, fast-track countries share some effective approaches in addressing three main areas to reduce maternal and child mortality. First, these countries engage multiple sectors to address crucial health determinants. Around half the reduction in child mortality in LMICs since 1990 is the result of health sector investments, the other half is attributed to investments made in sectors outside health. Second, these countries use strategies to mobilize partners across society, using timely, robust evidence for decision-making and accountability and a triple planning approach to consider immediate needs, long-term vision and adaptation to change. Third, the countries establish guiding principles that orient progress, align stakeholder action and achieve results over time.

The abstract ""Success Factors for Reducing Maternal and Child Mortality"" highlights the key themes and subjects related to reducing maternal and child mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The study uses statistical and econometric analyses, Boolean, qualitative comparative analysis, a literature review, and country-specific reviews to identify successful approaches in fast-track countries for achieving faster progress towards this goal.

The study reveals that while no standard formula exists, fast-track countries share three effective approaches to reducing maternal and child mortality:

1. Engaging multiple sectors: Around half the reduction in child mortality in LMICs since 1990 is attributed to investments made in sectors outside health. Fast-track countries engage multiple sectors to address crucial health determinants.

2. Mobilizing partners: Fast-track countries use strategies to mobilize partners across society, using timely, robust evidence for decision-making and accountability and a triple planning approach to consider immediate needs, long-term vision, and adaptation to change.

3. Establishing guiding principles: Fast-track countries establish guiding principles that orient progress, align stakeholder action, and achieve results over time.

The study suggests that these approaches enable fast-track countries to achieve faster progress towards reducing maternal and child mortality, but each country deploys tailored strategies to address the three main areas.

66,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:145140,"On the combined effect of soil fertility and topography on tree growth in subtropical forest ecosystems - a study from SE China
Aims: The aim of our research was to understand small-scale effects of topography and soil fertility on tree growth in a forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment in subtropical SE China.
Methods: Geomorphometric terrain analyses were carried out at a spatial resolution of 5×5 m. Soil samples of different depth increments and data on tree height were collected from a total of 566 plots (667 m2 each). The soils were analyzed for carbon (soil organic carbon [SOC]), nitrogen, acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations and base saturation as soil fertility attributes. All plots were classified into geomorphological units. Analyses of variance and linear regressions were applied to all terrain, soil fertility and tree growth attributes.
Important Findings: In general, young and shallow soils and relatively small differences in stable soil properties suggest that soil erosion has truncated the soils to a large extent over the whole area of the experiment. This explains the concurrently increasing CEC and SOC stocks downslope, in hollows and in valleys. However, colluvial, carbon-rich sediments are missing widely due to the convexity of the footslopes caused by uplift and removal of eroded sediments by adjacent waterways. The results showed that soil fertility is mainly influenced by topography. Monte–Carlo flow accumulation (MCCA), curvature, slope and aspect significantly affected soil fertility. Furthermore, soil fertility was affected by the different geomorphological positions on the experimental sites with ridge and spur positions showing lower exchangeable base cation contents, especially potassium (K), due to leaching. This geomorphological effect of soil fertility is most pronounced in the topsoil and decreases when considering the subsoil down to 50cm depth.

The abstract explores the relationship between soil fertility, topography, and tree growth in a subtropical forest ecosystem in SE China. The study aimed to understand the small-scale effects of topography and soil fertility on tree growth within a forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment. Geomorphometric terrain analyses were carried out, and soil samples were collected to analyze soil fertility attributes such as carbon, nitrogen, acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations, and base saturation. The study found that young and shallow soils have been truncated by soil erosion, resulting in carbon-rich sediments being missing due to convexity of footslopes caused by uplift and removal of eroded sediments by adjacent waterways. The results showed that soil fertility is mainly influenced by topography, and Monte–Carlo flow accumulation (MCCA), curvature, slope, and aspect significantly affected soil fertility. Ridge and spur positions showed lower exchangeable base cation contents, especially potassium (K), due to leaching, which is a geomorphological effect of soil fertility that is most pronounced in the topsoil and decreases when considering the subsoil down to 50cm depth. Few soil fertility attributes affect tree height after 1–2 years of growth, with carbon stocks being most important, while pHKCl and CEC played minor roles. Soil acidity and a high proportion of Al on the exchange complex affected tree height even after only 1–2 years growth.

Continuous, consistent, and long time-series from remote sensing are essential to monitoring changes on Earth's surface. However, analyzing such data sets is often challenging due to missing values introduced by cloud cover, missing orbits, sensor geometry artifacts, and so on. We propose a new and accurate spatio-temporal prediction method to replace missing values in remote sensing data sets. The method exploits the spatial coherence and temporal seasonal regularity that are inherent in many data sets. The key parts of the method are: 1) the adaptively chosen spatio-temporal subsets around missing values; 2) the ranking of images within the subsets based on a scoring algorithm; 3) the estimation of empirical quantiles characterizing the missing values; and 4) the prediction of missing values through quantile regression. One advantage of quantile regression is the robustness to outliers, which enables more accurate parameter retrieval in the analysis of remote sensing data sets. In addition, we provide bootstrap-based quantification of prediction uncertainties. The proposed prediction method was applied to a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data set from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and assessed with realistic test data sets featuring between 20% and 50% missing values. Validation against established methods showed that the proposed method has a good performance in terms of the root-mean-squared prediction error and significantly outperforms its competitors.

Juveniles who sexually offended (JSOs) are differentially burdened with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The present study used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to derive subtypes of JSOs according to their patterns of 10 different ACEs. An extensive file analysis of 322 male JSOs ( M = 14.14, SD = 1.94) revealed five subtypes with (a) multiple (9.0%), (b) mainly family related (17.1%), (c) mainly peer related (21.7%), (d) mainly neglectful (18.6%), and (e) little/no (33.5%) ACEs. Differences among ACE subtypes with regard to several offense and victim characteristics (e.g., the use of penetration or violence, the choice of a child, a male, a stranger, or multiple victims) were examined. Whereas no differences were found for the use of physical violence or the choice of male, stranger, or multiple victims, binary logistic regressions revealed associations of the multiple-ACE subtype with the choice of a child victim, the family-ACE subtype with the use of penetration as well as further nonsexual delinquency, the peer-ACE subtype with the use of penetration and the choice of a child victim, and the neglect-subtype with the choice of a child victim. Additional analyses including single ACE categories instead of LCA-derived subtypes supported these results.

Sufficiency is not a goal of environmental policy-making as is efficiency. In view of the planetary boundaries, this paper instead proposes that sufficiency should amend the notion of liberal society. The classic vision of liberal societies has been based on the core values of individual freedom, the no-harm principle and social justice together with the related virtues of courage, prudence and justice. By adding sufficiency, we introduce a fourth core value, one which is necessary for dealing with planetary boundaries. Temperance, the virtue linked to sufficiency, becomes an important part of this.",12,"
In this abstract, the authors explore the concept of sufficiency in the context of environmental policy and its relationship with liberal societies. They argue that while efficiency is a common goal in environmental policy, sufficiency should also be considered, particularly in light of planetary boundaries. The authors suggest that sufficiency should amend the notion of liberal society, which is traditionally based on values of individual freedom, the no-harm principle, and social justice, and add a fourth core value: sufficiency. The authors introduce temperance, the virtue associated with sufficiency, as an essential part of this updated vision of liberal societies. This proposal highlights the need for a new core value to address environmental issues in the context of liberal societies.","
The provided abstract touches on several SDGs related to sustainable development. Here are some highlights:

- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production: The concept of sufficiency, as proposed by the authors, aligns with the SDG's call for sustainable consumption and production patterns. By encouraging individuals to consume only what they need, sufficiency promotes a more sustainable and responsible approach to consumption.
- SDG 13: Climate Action: The authors' focus on planetary boundaries highlights the urgency of addressing climate change and the need for policies that consider the limits of the planet's resources.
- SDG 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The authors' proposal to add sufficiency as a fourth core value for liberal societies suggests a more just and equitable society, as individuals are encouraged to consume resources in a way that is fair and sustainable.
- SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals: The authors' call for a new vision of liberal societies that incorporates sufficiency and temperance highlights the need for collaboration and partnerships across different sectors and stakeholders to address environmental issues.

Overall, the authors' proposal underscores the importance of sustainability and responsibility in the context of liberal societies, which is a crucial step towards achieving the SDGs. However, it's essential to ensure that the introduction of sufficiency does not lead to a reduction in social justice or individual freedoms, as the traditional values of liberal societies are also crucial components of sustainable development.","

Depression and other psychic disorders are a common side effect of military missions abroad. A relatively new field of research investigates personal value orientations and moral injuries and inquires into the role they play in the onset of psycholo­gical problems following involvement in military operations.
In the present study, German Bundeswehr soldiers were tested psychometrically before and immediately after a mission in Afghanistan for value orientations, moral injuries, posttraumatic symptoms and depression. They were compared with a control group that had not undergone a military assignment abroad.
Value awareness (value index) changed significantly less in the task force than in the control group. Both this value index and the values «conformity« and «tradition« were significantly associated with the onset of depression in the task force.
In future, value orientations should be given closer attention both in the preparation of soldiers for deployment and in therapy for psychic disorders associated with deployment.",16,"
The abstract explores the relationship between value orientations, moral injuries, depression, and military operations abroad. The study involved testing German Bundeswehr soldiers for value orientations, moral injuries, posttraumatic symptoms, and depression both before and after a mission in Afghanistan, and comparing the results with a control group that had not undergone such a mission. The findings revealed that the overall value awareness changed less in the task force than in the control group, and the values conformity and tradition were significantly associated with the onset of depression in the task force. These results suggest that value orientations should be given greater consideration in the preparation of soldiers for deployment and in the therapy of psychic disorders related to deployment. Overall, the study sheds light on the role of value orientations and moral injuries in the onset of psychological problems following involvement in military operations abroad.","
The abstract touches on the SDGs related to health and well-being (SDG 3), peaceful societies (SDG 16), and partnerships for sustainable development (SDG 17). Here's how:

SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being: The study focuses on the mental health of soldiers returning from military operations abroad. Depression, a common mental health disorder, is identified as a side effect of such missions. The study's findings suggest that value orientations could be a contributing factor to the onset of depression, and this information could be used to improve the preparation and therapy of soldiers for deployment-related psychological problems.

SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The study highlights the importance of understanding the role of moral injuries in the onset of psychological problems following involvement in military operations abroad. Moral injuries, which can result from violating one's moral or ethical values, are a relatively new field of research. By investigating the role of moral injuries and value orientations in the onset of psychological problems, the study contributes to a better understanding of the causes of such problems, which could help to prevent or mitigate them in future missions.

SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: The study suggests that value orientations should be given greater consideration in the preparation of soldiers for deployment and in the therapy of psychic disorders related to deployment. This information could be used to improve partnerships between the military and mental health professionals, as well as between the military and other organizations involved in international peace missions. By addressing the mental health needs of soldiers returning from such missions, partnerships for sustainable development could be strengthened, as soldiers' well-being would be improved, and their contributions to peace missions would be more effective.

In summary, the study's findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of value orientations and moral injuries in the onset of psychological problems following involvement in military operations abroad. By improving the preparation and therapy of soldiers for deployment-related psychological problems, partnerships between the military and mental health professionals, and other organizations involved in international peace missions could be strengthened, contributing to improved mental health and well-being, and ultimately, to more effective peace missions.","

74,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:152153,"Remote sensing of plant-water relations: An overview and future perspectives
Vegetation is a highly dynamic component of the Earth surface and substantially alters the water cycle. Particularly the process of oxygenic plant photosynthesis determines vegetation connecting the water and carbon cycle and causing various interactions and feedbacks across Earth spheres. While vegetation impacts the water cycle, it reacts to changing water availability via functional, biochemical and structural responses. Unravelling the resulting complex feedbacks and interactions between the plant-water system and environmental change is essential for any modelling approaches and predictions, but still insufficiently understood due to currently missing observations. We hypothesize that an appropriate cross-scale monitoring of plant-water relations can be achieved by combined observational and modelling approaches. This paper reviews suitable remote sensing approaches to assess plant-water relations ranging from pure observational to combined observational-modelling approaches. We use a combined energy balance and radiative transfer model to assess the explanatory power of pure observational approaches focussing on plant parameters to estimate plant-water relations, followed by an outline for a more effective use of remote sensing by their integration into soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) models. We apply a mechanistic model simulating water movement in the SPAC to reveal insight into the complexity of relations between soil, plant and atmospheric parameters, and thus plant water relations. We conclude that future research should focus on strategies combining observations and mechanistic modelling to advance our knowledge on the interplay between the plant-water system and environmental change, e.g. through plant transpiration.",15,"

As social media sites have become significant arenas for political debate in recent years, this paper investigates the political debate that took place on Twitter in the wake of the Swiss referendum on the Nuclear Withdrawal Initiative, which was conducted in November 2016. Using Twitter data of 3000 users, we could identify 7 distinct communities that varied in terms of their size, position, and contribution to the debate. The most dominant communities in the debate were the Conservative Mainstream and the Green-Left communities. Moreover, our findings show that communities supporting and opposing the initiative differ with regard to the wording they use in their tweets. Finally, our results reveal an active exchange both within and, even more importantly, between the communities, which indicates a rather pluralistic and internally connected debate. Thus, our findings clearly contrast with those of prior studies concerning political debates on social media that identified pronounced echo chambers.",12,"

A simplistic view of the adaptive process pictures a hillside along which a population can climb: when ecological ‘demands’ change, evolution ‘supplies’ the variation needed for the population to climb to a new peak. Evolutionary ecologists point out that this simplistic view can be incomplete because the fitness landscape changes dynamically as the population evolves. Geneticists meanwhile have identified complexities relating to the nature of genetic variation and its architecture, and the importance of epigenetic variation is under debate. In this review, we highlight how complexity in both ecological ‘demands’ and the evolutionary ‘supply’ influences organisms’ ability to climb fitness landscapes that themselves change dynamically as evolution proceeds, and encourage new synthetic effort across research disciplines towards ecologically realistic studies of adaptation.",15,"

Focusing on the recent emergence of behavioral and experimental economics and its implications for the design and implementation of social policies, we demonstrate that geographies of marketization are not confined to the narrow study of the models of neoclassical economics. We structure our argument around what we perceive as key dimensions of marketization and their variegated geographies: First, we argue for renewed attention to the naturalization of abstract market knowledge and its methodological separation from real markets in the wake of the behavioral and experimental turn. We then turn to really existing markets, conceptualizing them as articulations of a variety of economic and social rationalities struggling over an apparent “moral market.” Third, we focus on the role of the nonhuman in marketization processes and discuss the work of market devices in making these market arrangements possible. In the fourth and final section we turn to the “human side” of marketization. Our argument is that market struggles connect with the formation of “quasi-subjects” that oscillate between attempts to reestablish autonomy and their dissolution in the disciplining webs of behavioral and experimental market devices. Throughout the text we illustrate our arguments on the so-called social impact bonds as a concrete example for the types of policy intervention informed by economic behaviorism and experimentalism.",8,"

While the provided abstract does not explicitly address the SDGs, it touches on themes that relate to several of them. Here are some insights and implications impacting SDGs:

SDG 1 - No Poverty: The authors discuss social impact bonds as a specific example of marketization in social policy, which has the potential to alleviate poverty by addressing social issues in innovative ways. This aligns with SDG 1, as social impact bonds aim to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, reduce inequality, and eradicate poverty in all its forms.

SDG 4 - Quality Education: The authors highlight the role of economic knowledge in marketization processes, including the emergence of behavioral and experimental economics. This emphasizes the importance of education in shaping economic knowledge and its impact on social policies. Education can help to promote critical thinking, challenge traditional economic models, and inform policies that are more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable.

SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation: The authors' discussion of real markets as the interplay of different economic and social rationalities raises questions about the role of marketization in access to clean water and sanitation. Market-based solutions may not always be inclusive or sustainable, particularly for vulnerable populations. SDG 6 aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, and this requires a nuanced understanding of the complex geographies of marketization and its implications for access to clean water and sanitation.

SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production: The authors' analysis of the role of nonhuman factors in marketization processes highlights the importance of responsible consumption and production patterns. Market devices, such as technology and infrastructure, play a significant role in marketization processes, and their design and implementation must be informed by sustainability and environmental concerns. SDG 12 aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, and this requires a critical understanding of the role of nonhuman factors in marketization processes.

SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: The authors' discussion of market struggles and the formation of quasi-subjects in marketization processes underscores the importance of partnerships and collaboration in shaping social policies. SDG 17 aims to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development, and this requires a critical understanding of the complex geographies of marketization and its implications for social policies.

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The abstract explores the impact of behavioral and experimental economics on social policies, which has implications for economic growth and decent work. The authors argue that the traditional focus on neoclassical economics models has led to a separation of abstract market knowledge from real markets, resulting in policies that may not be aligned with real-world economic realities. The authors suggest renewed attention to this naturalization and its implications for marketization, which could lead to more effective policies that promote economic growth and decent work. For example, the authors' analysis of social impact bonds highlights the importance of nonhuman factors in marketization processes, which could inform policies that address the role of technology and infrastructure in promoting economic growth and decent work.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The authors argue that marketization processes are complex and diverse, involving the interplay of different economic and social rationalities. This highlights the importance of responsible consumption and production, as policies that promote marketization should consider the social and environmental impact of economic activities. The authors' analysis of real markets, as well as their focus on the role of nonhuman factors in marketization processes, could inform policies that promote sustainable and responsible production and consumption patterns.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions

The authors discuss the formation of quasi-subjects in market struggles, highlighting the importance of strong institutions in promoting economic growth and decent work.

Tourists find it hard to evaluate the advantages of a sustainable hotel and others may be even sceptical about sustainable tourism altogether. The study reported here was designed to investigate the associations between perceived benefits, perceived costs, and perceived value while booking a sustainable hotel. In addition, the moderating role of scepticism is assessed relating the paths linking the study variables. The study is based on an online survey carried out with1056 respondents in the USA. The results of structural equation modeling indicate that the perceived benefits, both authentic and environmental benefits were significantly influencing perceived value; and perceived value had a significant influence on booking intentions. The moderating effect of scepticism on authentic benefit perceptions with perceived value suggests that when respondents are sceptical about sustainability in general, it alters the relationship between authentic benefit perceptions and perceived value showing a negative impact. The study provides implications for sustainable hotel marketing by emphasising the need to understand how potential consumers perceive the sustainable product value and how this affects their booking intentions.",12,"

Members of conflicting groups experience threats to different identity dimensions, resulting in the need to restore the aspect of identity that was threatened. Do these needs translate into specific goals in social interactions? In the present research, we examined the hypotheses that (1) experiencing one’s ingroup as illegitimately disadvantaged or victimized arouses agentic goals (to act and appear assertive and confident) when interacting with the advantaged or victimizing group, while (2) experiencing one’s ingroup as illegitimately advantaged or perpetrating transgressions arouses communal goals (to act and appear warm and trustworthy) when interacting with the disadvantaged or victimized group. Study 1 (N = 391) generally supported both hypotheses across diverse intergroup contexts involving gender, national/ethnic, and consumer identities. Study 2 (N = 122) replicated this pattern in a context of occupational identities. Study 2 further showed that the effect of ingroup role on agentic and communal intergroup goals was not moderated by participants’ general dispositional preferences for agentic and communal goals in interpersonal interactions, thus demonstrating how ingroup role exerts a distinct and robust influence on goals for interactions with other groups.

Seligman (2011) provided a new framework of well-being suggesting five dimensions that encompass both hedonic and eudemonic aspects of well-being: positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning and accomplishment (forming the acronym PERMA). However, the role of character strengths has not been studied so far in this framework. Also, most studies on the relationships between character strengths and well-being only have only relied on self-reports. This set of two studies examines the relationships of character strengths and the orientations to well-being in two cross-sectional studies (Study 1: N = 5521), while also taking informant-reports into account and utilizing different questionnaires to control for a possible method bias (Study 2: N = 172). Participants completed validated assessments of character strengths and the PERMA dimensions (self-reports in Study 1, self- and informant-reports in Study 2). Results showed that in self-reports, all strengths were positively related to all PERMA dimensions, but there were differences in the size of the relationships. Accomplishment, for example, showed the strongest associations with strengths such as perspective, persistence, and zest, whereas for positive relationships, strengths such as teamwork, love, and kindness were the best predictors. These findings were largely confirmed by informant-reports in Study 2. The findings provide further support for the notion that character contributes to well-being and they could guide the development of strengths-based interventions tailored to individual needs.",3,"
The provided abstract explores the relationship between character strengths and a multidimensional framework of well-being called PERMA. The first study (N = 5521) analyzed self-reported data, while the second study (N = 172) included both self- and informant-reports. Both studies found that all character strengths were positively related to all dimensions of well-being, with some differences in the strength of the relationships. For example, accomplishment strengths such as perspective, persistence, and zest were most strongly associated with the accomplishment dimension, while teamwork, love, and kindness were the best predictors for positive relationships. These findings support the notion that character strengths contribute to well-being and could guide the development of personalized interventions. Overall, the abstract highlights the importance of character strengths in promoting well-being and suggests potential avenues for further research and intervention development.","
The provided abstract relates to SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in the context of promoting well-being and sustainable development. Character strengths, which are positively valued traits, have been linked to subjective well-being in previous studies.

84,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:153142,"Assessing Indirect Environmental Effects of Information and Communication Technology (ICT): A Systematic Literature Review
Indirect environmental effects of information and communication technology (ICT) are those effects of ICT that change patterns of production or consumption in domains other than ICT, or more precisely, the environmental consequences of these changes. Digitalization as the societal process of ICT-driven change has created increasing interest in the indirect environmental effects of this technology. Assessments of indirect effects face various methodological challenges, such as the definition of the system boundary, the definition of a baseline as a reference or the occurrence of rebound effects. Existing studies use various approaches or methods to assess a spectrum of ICT use cases in several application domains. In view of the large number of assessments that have been conducted, the choices made when applying assessment methods, and the variety of ICT use cases in different application domains investigated, we present a systematic literature review of existing assessments of indirect environmental effects of ICT. The review provides a state-of-the-art overview of the methods used in the research field and is intended to support researchers in designing sound assessments which yield significant results. We identified 54 studies in seven main application domains using 15 different assessment approaches. The most common application domains are virtual mobility (e.g., telecommuting), virtual goods (e.g., digital media), and smart transport (e.g., route optimization). Life-cycle assessment, partial footprint, and the “ICT enablement method” are the most common approaches. The major part of the assessments focuses on patterns of production (e.g., production of paper-based books vs. e-books), a smaller part on patterns of consumption (e.g., changes in media consumption). Based on these results, we identify as a research gap the investigation of ICT impacts on consumer behavior, which could, for example, focus on social practices, and account for the dynamic implications of change. Elaborating such an approach could provide valuable insights into ICT’s impact on society and the resulting environmental consequences.",12,"

85,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168385,"Cropping practices manipulate abundance patterns of root and soil microbiome members paving the way to smart farming
Background Harnessing beneficial microbes presents a promising strategy to optimize plant growth and agricultural sustainability. Little is known to which extent and how specifically soil and plant microbiomes can be manipulated through different cropping practices. Here, we investigated soil and wheat root microbial communities in a cropping system experiment consisting of conventional and organic managements, both with different tillage intensities.
Results While microbial richness was marginally affected, we found pronounced cropping effects on community composition, which were specific for the respective microbiomes. Soil bacterial communities were primarily structured by tillage, whereas soil fungal communities responded mainly to management type with additional effects by tillage. In roots, management type was also the driving factor for bacteria but not for fungi, which were generally determined by changes in tillage intensity. To quantify an “effect size” for microbiota manipulation, we found that about 10% of variation in microbial communities was explained by the tested cropping practices. Cropping sensitive microbes were taxonomically diverse, and they responded in guilds of taxa to the specific practices. These microbes also included frequent community members or members co-occurring with many other microbes in the community, suggesting that cropping practices may allow manipulation of influential community members.
Conclusions Understanding the abundance patterns of cropping sensitive microbes presents the basis towards developing microbiota management strategies for smart farming. For future targeted microbiota management—e.g., to foster certain microbes with specific agricultural practices—a next step will be to identify the functional traits of the cropping sensitive microbes.",2,"
This abstract explores the effects of different cropping practices on soil and wheat root microbial communities, specifically comparing conventional and organic management with varying tillage intensities.

People differ. Not only do they vote for different parties, buy different products, have different hobbies and use different media. They also differ in their interest in, attitudes on, and behavior towards scientific and environmental issues. This has been shown for people’s general assessments of environmental issues (e.g. Eurobarometer, 2017) and of science and research (for an overview see Besley, 2013). It has also been demonstrated for people’s attitudes towards more specific topics such as global warming (for an overview see Nisbet & Myers, 2007), nuclear energy (e.g. Kristiansen, Bonfadelli, & Kovic, 2016), nanotechnology (e.g. Scheufele, Corley, Shih, Dalrymple, & Ho, 2009), or biotechnology (e.g. Bonfadelli, 2017).

Understanding how the natural world will be impacted by environmental change over the coming decades is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental change can generate both population-level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or nonadaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends on whether plastic responses are adaptive or nonadaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change or whether simpler nonevolutionary models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.",15,"

We study whether leaders influence the unethical conduct of followers. To avoid selection issues present in natural environments, we use an experiment in which we create simple laboratory firms and assign leadership roles at random. In our first experiment, firms engage in competition and unethical behavior enhances firm earnings but produces a negative externality for all firms. We vary, by treatment, two instruments through which leaders can influence follower conduct—prominent statements to the group and the allocation of monetary incentives. We find that leaders influence the ethical conduct of followers both through their statements and through the use of incentives. Moreover, leaders who are likely to have acted dishonestly in a preliminary stage of the experiment are more likely to employ mechanisms to encourage dishonesty among followers. As a result, firms randomly assigned one of these unethical leaders are more likely to engage in misreporting. A second experiment finds that the above relationships are present, though weaker, when firms do not engage in direct competition.",16,"
This abstract explores whether leaders impact the ethical conduct of their followers. Using a lab experiment to avoid selection issues, the study creates simple firms and randomly assigns leadership roles. In the first experiment, unethical behavior increases firm earnings but negatively affects all firms. Leaders influence follower conduct through prominent statements and incentive allocation. Unethical leaders from a preliminary stage are more likely to encourage dishonesty among followers. As a result, firms with these leaders are more likely to engage in misreporting. In a second experiment, the relationships hold, though weaker, when firms do not directly compete. Overall, the study finds that leaders affect ethical conduct through statements and incentives, with unethical leaders more likely to promote dishonesty.","
The provided abstract focuses on sustainable development in relation to the SDGs of Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3) and Peace and Justice Strong Institutions (SDG 16). 

In the first experiment, unethical behavior, which may negatively affect the health and well-being of individuals and communities, is found to enhance firm earnings. This highlights the importance of promoting good health and well-being through the prevention of unethical behavior in the workplace, as well as the need for strong institutions to hold leaders accountable for their actions and prevent negative externalities. 

Moreover, the study suggests that leaders who are likely to have acted dishonestly in a preliminary stage are more likely to employ mechanisms to encourage dishonesty among followers. This underscores the need for strong institutions to promote transparency, accountability, and good governance to prevent unethical leaders from promoting dishonesty and misconduct. 

In a second experiment, the relationships between leaders and follower conduct hold, but weaker. This suggests that the impact of leaders on follower behavior may be less significant in some contexts, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of leadership dynamics and their impact on sustainable development. 

Overall, the study sheds light on the importance of promoting good health and well-being and strong institutions to prevent unethical behavior and promote sustainable development.

93,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:130718,"Contrasting radiation and soil heat fluxes in Arctic shrub and wet sedge tundra
Vegetation changes, such as shrub encroachment and wetland expansion, have been observed in many Arctic tundra regions. These changes feed back to permafrost and climate. Permafrost can be protected by soil shading through vegetation as it reduces the amount of solar energy available for thawing. Regional climate can be affected by a reduction in surface albedo as more energy is available for atmospheric and soil heating. Here, we compared the shortwave radiation budget of two common Arctic tundra vegetation types dominated by dwarf shrubs (Betula nana) and wet sedges (Eriophorum angustifolium) in North-East Siberia. We measured time series of the shortwave and longwave radiation budget above the canopy and transmitted radiation below the canopy. Additionally, we quantified soil temperature and heat flux as well as active layer thickness. The mean growing season albedo of dwarf shrubs was 0.15 ± 0.01, for sedges it was higher (0.17 ± 0.02). Dwarf shrub transmittance was 0.36 ± 0.07 on average, and sedge transmittance was 0.28 ± 0.08. The standing dead leaves contributed strongly to the soil shading of wet sedges. Despite a lower albedo and less soil shading, the soil below dwarf shrubs conducted less heat resulting in a 17 cm shallower active layer as compared to sedges. This result was supported by additional, spatially distributed measurements of both vegetation types. Clouds were a major influencing factor for albedo and transmittance, particularly in sedge vegetation. Cloud cover reduced the albedo by 0.01 in dwarf shrubs and by 0.03 in sedges, while transmittance was increased by 0.08 and 0.10 in dwarf shrubs and sedges, respectively. Our results suggest that the observed deeper active layer below wet sedges is not primarily a result of the summer canopy radiation budget. Soil properties, such as soil albedo, moisture, and thermal conductivity, may be more influential, at least in our comparison between dwarf shrub vegetation on relatively dry patches and sedge vegetation with higher soil moisture.",13,"
In this abstract, the authors investigate the contrasting radiation and soil heat fluxes in two common Arctic tundra vegetation types: dwarf shrubs (Betula nana) and wet sedges (Eriophorum angustifolium). The study aims to understand the impact of vegetation changes, such as shrub encroachment and wetland expansion, on permafrost and climate. The authors measured time series of shortwave and longwave radiation budgets above and below the canopy, as well as soil temperature, heat flux, and active layer thickness. They found that the mean growing season albedo was higher for wet sedges (E. Angustifolium) (0.17 ± 0.02) than for dwarf shrubs (B. Nana) (0.15 ± 0.01). However, despite a lower albedo and less soil shading, the soil below dwarf shrubs conducted less heat, resulting in a 17cm shallower active layer as compared to sedges. The authors suggest that soil properties, such as soil albedo, moisture, and thermal conductivity, may be more influential than the summer canopy radiation budget for the observed deeper active layer below wet sedges. They also found that clouds were a major influencing factor for albedo and transmittance, particularly in sedge vegetation, with cloud cover reducing the albedo and increasing the transmittance for both vegetation types. The results suggest that vegetation changes in the Arctic tundra may have complex feedbacks on permafrost and climate, with multiple factors influencing the soil heat fluxes.","
In terms of its relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this abstract touches on a few key areas. 

SDG 13 - Climate Action: The study's focus on the impact of vegetation changes on permafrost and climate is directly related to SDG 13. As the Arctic warms at a faster rate than the global average, permafrost thawing and its subsequent impact on greenhouse gas emissions is a major concern for global climate change. The authors' findings highlight the complex feedbacks between vegetation, soil, and climate, and suggest that multiple factors need to be considered in order to understand the full impact of vegetation changes on climate.

SDG 15 - Life on Land: The study also touches on SDG 15, as it investigates the impact of two common Arctic tundra vegetation types on soil properties. Changes in vegetation cover can have a significant impact on soil moisture, nutrient cycling, and carbon storage, all of which are important for maintaining the health and productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. The authors' findings suggest that soil properties, such as soil albedo, moisture, and thermal conductivity, may be more influential than the summer canopy radiation budget for the observed deeper active layer below wet sedges. This highlights the importance of considering the full range of factors that contribute to soil health and productivity in Arctic tundra ecosystems.

Overall, this abstract contributes to our understanding of the complex feedbacks between vegetation, soil, and climate in Arctic tundra ecosystems, which is crucial for informing policy and decision-making related to SDGs 13 and 15. By shedding light on the multiple factors that contribute to soil heat fluxes, the study provides important insights into the ways in which vegetation changes in the Arctic tundra may impact permafrost and climate, and suggests that a holistic approach is needed in order to fully understand the impacts of these changes.","

94,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157398,"Understanding forest health with remote sensing, part III: Requirements for a scalable multi-source forest health monitoring network based on data science approaches
Forest ecosystems fulfill a whole host of ecosystem functions that are essential for life on our planet. However, an unprecedented level of anthropogenic influences is reducing the resilience and stability of our forest ecosystems as well as their ecosystem functions. The relationships between drivers, stress, and ecosystem functions in forest ecosystems are complex, multi-faceted, and often non-linear, and yet forest managers, decision makers, and politicians need to be able to make rapid decisions that are data-driven and based on short and long-term monitoring information, complex modeling, and analysis approaches. A huge number of long-standing and standardized forest health inventory approaches already exist, and are increasingly integrating remote-sensing based monitoring approaches. Unfortunately, these approaches in monitoring, data storage, analysis, prognosis, and assessment still do not satisfy the future requirements of information and digital knowledge processing of the 21st century. Therefore, this paper discusses and presents in detail five sets of requirements, including their relevance, necessity, and the possible solutions that would be necessary for establishing a feasible multi-source forest health monitoring network for the 21st century. Namely, these requirements are: (1) understanding the effects of multiple stressors on forest health; (2) using remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor forest health; (3) coupling different monitoring approaches; (4) using data science as a bridge between complex and multidimensional big forest health (FH) data; and (5) a future multi-source forest health monitoring network. It became apparent that no existing monitoring approach, technique, model, or platform is sufficient on its own to monitor, model, forecast, or assess forest health and its resilience. In order to advance the development of a multi-source forest health monitoring network, we argue that in order to gain a better understanding of forest health in our complex world, it would be conducive to implement the concepts of data science with the components: (i) digitalization; (ii) standardization with metadata management after the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles; (iii) Semantic Web; (iv) proof, trust, and uncertainties; (v) tools for data science analysis; and (vi) easy tools for scientists, data managers, and stakeholders for decision-making support.",15,"

The changes observed in resourcing international organisations over the last decades may have dramatic consequences for their ability to fulfil their mandates. This paper investigates into how far reaching the expected changes really are, and whether the new types and sources of financial and human resources can really be considered as causal for these developments. It appears that resourcing may not be the initial cause, but contributes to the centrifugal dynamics currently observed in the multilateral system. Administrative cost related to the new and complex funding structures are considerable, and ensuring transparency over resource flows represents a major challenge. Official decision-making bodies lose power to sub-groups of members or external actors that fund parts of the organisations’ activities through separate channels. Given the large volume of non-core funding and the lack of transparency, they cannot easily adjust their own priorities. It can thus not be expected that the funding of certain activities through external channels will simply be compensated by a corresponding reduction of core funding in this area. Whether this negatively affects the ability of the organisations to fulfil their mandates – and hence, eventually their legitimacy – depends on the motivations of those actors empowered in this process.",17,"

Context:
The abstract belongs to the field of international relations and development studies, specifically focusing on the resourcing of international organizations. The terms and concepts mentioned, such as multilateral system, official decision-making bodies, and centrifugal dynamics, are standard terminology in this field. The analysis is contextually informed","
In terms of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this abstract touches upon several themes that could impact various goals. Here are some potential implications:

- SDG 1 (No Poverty): The paper highlights that the changes in resourcing international organizations may affect their ability to fulfill their mandates, which could impact their capacity to address poverty-related issues. The loss of power for official decision-making bodies to sub-groups of members or external actors could result in a shift in priorities that does not align with poverty reduction efforts. Additionally, the lack of transparency over resource flows could lead to a misallocation of funds, which could exacerbate poverty and inequality.

- SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation): The paper notes that the loss of power for official decision-making bodies to sub-groups of members or external actors could impact the management and funding of water and sanitation programs. If external actors fund separate channels for water and sanitation programs, it could result in a fragmentation of efforts and a lack of coordination between programs. This could lead to duplication of resources and a failure to achieve sustainable water and sanitation solutions.

- SDG 13 (Climate Action): The paper suggests that the new types and sources of financial and human resources could contribute to centrifugal dynamics in the multilateral system, which could impact the effectiveness of climate action initiatives. If external actors fund separate channels for climate action programs, it could result in a lack of coordination between programs and a failure to achieve collective action. Additionally, the loss of power for official decision-making bodies could result in a weakening of institutional capacities to manage and respond to climate change challenges.

- SDG 16 (Peace and Justice Strong Institutions): The paper highlights that the loss of power for official decision-making bodies could impact the ability of organizations to fulfill their mandates related to peace and justice issues. If sub-groups of members or external actors fund separate channels for peace and justice initiatives, it could result in a fragmentation of efforts and a lack of coordination between programs. Additionally, the lack of transparency over resource flows could lead to a misallocation of funds, which could undermine efforts to promote peace and justice.

SDG 9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure
The abstract sheds light on the European Emission Trading System (ETS) as a transaction network, which falls under the infrastructure category. The analysis reveals that the lack of clear trading institutions has led to the use of local connections and financial intermediaries, creating a hierarchical structure in the network. This structure, in turn, has resulted in market inefficiencies, such as increased bid-ask spread, which is an indirect impact on SDG 9's goal of enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. Although the efficiency of the ETS has improved in Phase II, the persistence of asymmetries imposes additional costs on agents, indicating an indirect negative impact on SDG 9's objective of promoting a resource-efficient, sustainable, and low-carbon economy.

SDG 13: Climate action
The European Emission Trading System (ETS) is a vital component in the fight against climate change. The analysis in the abstract indicates that the asymmetries in the network induced by the absence of clear trading institutions resulted in informational asymmetries and market inefficiencies. This implies that the ETS may not be functioning as efficiently as possible, thereby reducing its effectiveness as a mitigation instrument. The indirect negative impact on SDG 13's objective of taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts is evident.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals
The European Emission Trading System (ETS) is a crucial aspect of international efforts to address climate change.

In this article, however, we introduce policy change as a new potential determinant in the process of issue evolution. Moreover, in contrast to most of the literature that investigates the role of policy outcomes (such as economic growth or unemployment) on voting decisions, we analyze the effect of laws which can be directly attributed to governments and political parties. We focus on within-country variation and analyze national election surveys from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany between 1994 and 2011. These surveys include information on both self- and party-placements regarding immigration issues. To measure policy changes, we use data on immigration policies from the newly built Immigration Policies in Comparison dataset. While we expect a general reform effect, we investigate in more detail whether liberal and restrictive reforms have a similar effect on votes for left/right, government/opposition parties. It is shown that both liberal and restrictive reforms lead to increasing issue voting. While we show that government parties are not more affected than opposition parties, we see that party ideology partly plays a role.",10,"
The abstract analyzes the impact of immigration reforms on voting behavior, specifically how policy changes related to immigration affect migration as a vote-defining issue in upcoming elections. The article differentiates itself from previous research by focusing on policy change as a determinant in issue evolution, rather than the role of issue entrepreneurs. It also investigates the effect of laws directly attributed to governments and political parties, rather than policy outcomes. The study uses national election surveys from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany from 1994 to 2011, analyzing both self- and party-placements regarding immigration issues. The researchers measure policy changes using data from the Immigration Policies in Comparison dataset, and investigate the effect of both liberal and restrictive reforms on voting for left/right and government/opposition parties. The results show that both types of reforms lead to increasing issue voting, with no significant difference in effect between government and opposition parties, but with a role for party ideology.","
The provided abstract does not directly relate to any of the SDGs. However, there are some indirect implications that could impact SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities. The study investigates the effect of immigration reforms on voting behavior, which could potentially lead to policies that favor one political party over another. If liberal or restrictive reforms lead to increasing issue voting, as the study suggests, this could result in political parties prioritizing these issues over others, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities or creating new ones. Moreover, as the study highlights, party ideology partly plays a role in this effect, indicating that political affiliation could also contribute to inequalities. Therefore, it is essential to consider the potential socioeconomic impacts of immigration reforms on vulnerable populations and to ensure that policies are implemented in a way that reduces inequalities rather than exacerbating them. This could involve measures such as ensuring access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities for all, regardless of immigration status, as well as addressing issues of social and economic exclusion that can contribute to inequality. As such, policymakers should consider the implications of this study, particularly in relation to SDG 10, when designing and implementing immigration reforms.","

Losses and gains in species diversity affect ecological stability1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and the sustainability of ecosystem functions and services8,9,10,11,12,13. Experiments and models have revealed positive, negative and no effects of diversity on individual components of stability, such as temporal variability, resistance and resilience2,3,6,11,12,14. How these stability components covary remains poorly understood15. Similarly, the effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability16, which is conceptually akin to ecosystem multifunctionality17,18, remain unknown. Here we studied communities of aquatic ciliates to understand how temporal variability, resistance and overall ecosystem stability responded to diversity (that is, species richness) in a large experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems sampled 19 times over 40 days, resulting in 12,939 samplings. Species richness increased temporal stability but decreased resistance to warming. Thus, two stability components covaried negatively along the diversity gradient. Previous biodiversity manipulation studies rarely reported such negative covariation despite general predictions of the negative effects of diversity on individual stability components3. Integrating our findings with the ecosystem multifunctionality concept revealed hump- and U-shaped effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability. That is, biodiversity can increase overall ecosystem stability when biodiversity is low, and decrease it when biodiversity is high, or the opposite with a U-shaped relationship. The effects of diversity on ecosystem multifunctionality would also be hump- or U-shaped if diversity had positive effects on some functions and negative effects on others. Linking the ecosystem multifunctionality concept and ecosystem stability can transform the perceived effects of diversity on ecological stability and may help to translate this science into policy-relevant information.",15,"

This study investigated the microbiological quality and presence of bacterial foodborne pathogens in 51 raw milk cheeses (mainly semihard and hard cheese) and 53 raw meat products (cured meat products and sausages) marketed at farm level. With regard to Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia (E.) coli, and coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), the examined products were generally of a good microbiological quality. Enterobacteriaceae were found in seven cheeses (1.0×102 – 8.8×104 CFU/g) and one sausage (2.0×102 CFU/g). Three of these cheeses were also positive for E. coli. CPS results were comparable for cheeses (5.9%; 1.0-6.0×102 CFU/g) and meat products (3.8%; 1.0-2.0×102 CFU/g). On the other hand, such raw products may harbor potential health hazards as Listeria (L.) monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), and staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE)-producing Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. L. monocytogenes were found in one sausage and the isolate belonged to the serotype 1/2c. The two STEC isolates harbored stx1a (cheese) or stx2e (sausage), but both lacked eae and did not belong to the top five-serogroups. Of the five S. aureus isolates, the three cheese isolates belonged to the clonal complex (CC) 8, CC22, and CC705, the two sausage isolates belonged to CC7, and all isolates harbored genes for SEs. Thus, to avoid contaminations and to prevent foodborne pathogens from entering the food chain, strict compliance with good hygiene practices during milk and cheese production or meat production is of central importance.",3,"
The abstract investigates the microbiological quality and presence of foodborne pathogens in raw milk cheeses and raw meat products sold directly from farms in Switzerland.

OBJECTIVE

Case management (CM) programs are intended to improve care coordination for cancer patients. This quasi-experimental, controlled study evaluated whether such a program was effective in improving health-related quality of life and reducing the psychological distress of breast cancer patients.

METHODS

For the study, 126 patients with CM and 118 patients with treatment as usual (TAU) were surveyed at baseline, a 6-month follow-up and a 12-month follow-up. Comparisons of the two groups with regard to quality of life (Short Form-8, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-11; primary outcome) and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, distress thermometer; secondary outcome) were conducted.

RESULTS

Univariate t-tests regarding the primary and secondary outcomes demonstrated improvements in the relevant outcomes at the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups for the intervention group as well as for the control group. An analysis of covariance revealed that the controls showed a higher level of physical quality of life at the 12-month follow-up than the other time points and no differences at 6 months after the baseline.

CONCLUSIONS

The tested CM model did not improve the quality of life or psychological well-being of the patients beyond treatment as usual. Possible reasons include that the treatment was already of high standards in the control group or that there are possibly different impacts than found in the literature regarding different forms of organization in CM. The need for and the tailoring of this CM model as well as the transfer of CM to other oncological indications remain to be clarified. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",3,"
The abstract presents a study evaluating the effectiveness of case management (CM) for breast cancer patients in improving health-related quality of life and reducing psychological distress. The study employed a quasi-experimental, controlled design with 126 CM patients and 118 treatment as usual (TAU) patients. At baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups, both groups showed improvements in quality of life and psychological distress outcomes. However, the control group demonstrated a higher level of physical quality of life at the 12-month follow-up than at 6 months. The study suggests that the tested CM model did not show superior outcomes compared to TAU, possibly due to the high standard of treatment in the control group or differences in CM impacts compared to previous literature. Further research is needed to clarify the need and tailoring of CM as well as its transferability to other oncological indications.","

In terms of its relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the abstract does not explicitly address any of the 17 goals. However, the concept of digital freedoms mentioned in the abstract can be related to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions).

SDG 9 aims to promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. Personalization technologies fall under this goal as they are a form of innovation that can contribute to sustainable development. The potential benefits of personalization, such as reducing information overload and improving user experience, can lead to more efficient and sustainable use of resources. However, the impact of personalization on social values, as discussed in the abstract, raises questions about its normative effect and its potential to create echo chambers that threaten deliberative democracy. As such, it is crucial to critically evaluate the normative effects of personalization technologies to ensure that they align with social values and contribute to sustainable development.

SDG 16 aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. The abstract touches on the impact of personalization technologies on individual and social autonomies, highlighting the need to understand how code affects these autonomies. This raises questions about the role of computers in decision-making and their potential to shift decision-making power from humans to computers. This issue has implications for digital freedoms, as it raises concerns about the potential for personalization algorithms to limit individual and social autonomies in ways that undermine democratic decision-making and access to justice. As such, it is crucial to ensure that personalization technologies are developed in a way that promotes digital freedoms and respects individual and social autonomies, in line with SDG 16.

Overall, while the abstract does not explicitly address any of the SDGs, it touches on themes related to SDG 9 and SDG 16, highlighting the need for a critical evaluation of personalization technologies and their impact on digital freedoms and social values. As such, it underscores the importance of ensuring that personalization technologies are developed in a way that aligns with SDG 9 and SDG 16, promoting sustainable industrialization and respecting individual and social autonomies.","

Biodiversity experiments have shown that species loss reduces ecosystem functioning in grassland.

We manipulated tree species richness by planting more than 150,000 trees in plots with 1 to 16 species. Simulating multiple extinction scenarios, we found that richness strongly increased stand-level productivity. After 8 years, 16-species mixtures had accumulated over twice the amount of carbon found in average monocultures and similar amounts as those of two commercial monocultures. Species richness effects were strongly associated with functional and phylogenetic diversity. A shrub addition treatment reduced tree productivity, but this reduction was smaller at high shrub species richness.

109,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:161795,"The mass politics of international disintegration
In the past few years, the world has witnessed an unprecedented popular backlash against international institutions. Popular demands to not only slow down, but to reverse international integration have proliferated, and have resulted in referendum and election outcomes that have reverberated across the world. Examples range from the Swiss 2014 mass immigration initiative over the British 2016 Brexit referendum to the 2016 election of a US President seemingly determined to withdraw US support from various international treaties. The implications of these mass-based disintegration efforts reach far beyond the countries in which they originate. First, the disintegration process is shaped by how remaining member states respond to one member’s bid to unilaterally change or terminate the terms of an existing international agreement. Second, mass-based disintegration bids also pose considerable risks of political contagion by encouraging disintegrative tendencies in other countries. Yet despite their disruptive nature, very little research exists beyond individual case studies on the general drivers, dynamics and challenges these instances of mass-based disintegration pose for international cooperation. This paper therefore engages in a comparative inquiry into the mass politics of disintegration that pays particular attention to the strategic dilemmas these instances pose for the affected international institutions and their remaining member states. It argues that the remaining member states have incentives to intervene in domestic campaigns in which disintegration figures as a viable outcome, but that the difficulties of successful intervention are considerable. It also shows that after a vote in favor of disintegration, the remaining member states face an “accommodation dilemma” between preserving as many cooperation gains as possible and making exit costly in order to discourage other member states from following suit.",17,"
The abstract explores the unprecedented trend of popular backlash against international institutions, resulting in demands for disintegration. Examples include the Swiss immigration initiative and the UK's Brexit referendum, which have led to significant political implications beyond their respective countries. The paper investigates the general drivers, dynamics, and challenges posed by these instances of mass-based disintegration for international cooperation. The paper argues that remaining member states face strategic dilemmas in intervening in domestic campaigns where disintegration is a viable outcome, but the difficulties of successful intervention are considerable. After a vote in favor of disintegration, the remaining member states must navigate the ""accommodation dilemma"" of balancing cooperation gains and making exit costly to deter further disintegrative tendencies. This comparative inquiry sheds light on the mass politics of disintegration and its impact on international cooperation.","
While this abstract does not explicitly address the SDGs, it touches on several themes that have implications for sustainable development.

SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The abstract highlights the disruptive nature of mass-based disintegration efforts and their potential risks of political contagion, which could have negative impacts on peace and justice. As remaining member states navigate the challenges posed by disintegration, they must also consider the potential for further disintegrative tendencies and the impact this could have on institutions and the rule of law.

SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: The abstract suggests that the remaining member states have incentives to intervene in domestic campaigns against disintegration, highlighting the importance of partnerships and cooperation in addressing international challenges. The difficulties of successful intervention, however, underscore the need for effective partnerships and strategies to address disintegration efforts and maintain international cooperation.

SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth: The impact of mass-based disintegration efforts on economic growth and decent work is not explicitly addressed in the abstract, but the implications of disintegration for cooperation gains and exit costs could have significant economic consequences for remaining member states. As such, this theme is indirectly related to the issues raised in the abstract.

In terms of recommendations for addressing mass-based disintegration efforts, promoting partnerships and cooperation could help mitigate the risks of political contagion and prevent further disintegrative tendencies. Remaining member states could also consider strategies for making exit costs prohibitive to deter other member states from following suit. Furthermore, efforts to address the drivers and dynamics of mass-based disintegration, such as addressing the root causes of popular backlash against international institutions, could help prevent further disintegrative efforts and promote sustainable development.

While the SDGs are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, their implications are present in the issues raised. By considering the impact of mass-based disintegration efforts on themes such as peace, justice, partnerships, and economic growth, we can gain a better understanding of the broader implications of disintegration for sustainable development.","
SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
While the abstract does not directly address SDG 12, it touches upon the impact of mass-based disintegration on international cooperation, which can affect responsible consumption and production patterns. Disintegration can lead to the unraveling of international agreements and regulatory frameworks that promote sustainable production and consumption, thereby hampering progress towards SDG 12. Therefore, understanding the drivers, dynamics, and challenges of mass-based disintegration is crucial to devising strategies that promote responsible consumption and production patterns in the context of international cooperation.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals
The abstract highlights the need for remaining member states to navigate the strategic dilemmas posed by mass-based disintegration. This requires partnerships with other member states and international institutions to devise effective responses that balance cooperation gains and exit costs. The paper argues that successful intervention in domestic campaigns is challenging, and partnerships can help overcome these challenges by pooling resources, expertise, and knowledge. Moreover, remaining member states can leverage partnerships to create new institutional arrangements that promote cooperation and prevent further instances of mass-based disintegration.

Overall, while the abstract does not explicitly address SDGs 12 and 17, it sheds light on the complex interplay between mass-based disintegration, international cooperation, and sustainable production and consumption patterns. The study's insights can inform strategies for achieving SDGs 12 and 17 by better understanding the drivers, dynamics, and challenges of mass-based disintegration and developing partnerships that promote responsible consumption and production patterns and international cooperation.","

Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a widespread problem in human nutrition and wheat grains are a major source of Zn intake in large parts of the human population. It remains unclear to what extent organic and conventional farming practices, differing in organic matter management, influence Zn availability and uptake by wheat grains. Factors leading to an increased Zn uptake may also increase the Cd uptake in wheat grains, which are a major source of harmful Cd for humans. In this study, we investigated the effects of different farming practices on Zn and Cd concentrations in wheat grains and their relationships with total and available soil Zn and Cd concentrations, and other soil properties. In northern Switzerland, 28 farms were sampled including 11 organic farms with compost use, 10 organic farms without compost use, and 7 conventional farms without compost use. Soil organic matter was a key factor for soil Zn and especially Cd concentrations across all three farming systems. Total and available soil Cd concentrations as well as soil organic carbon concentration (SOC) were significantly higher on the organic farms with compost use than on the conventional farms. However, only the compost farms with livestock showed significantly higher grain Cd concentrations in comparison to conventional farming, whereas the organic farms without compost use were in between. In contrast to Cd, the soil and grain Zn concentrations showed no significant farming system effect although there was a correlation between total soil Zn and SOC when all farms of the survey were pooled. Grain Zn was decoupled from soil Zn indicating that under agricultural field conditions the farming systems are a minor factor in increasing grain Zn. Our study suggests that the Zn and Cd soil and grain concentrations on farms were mediated by a combination of on-farm organic matter management, soil properties, and livestock production intensity.",2,"
The abstract examines the effects of organic and conventional farming practices on wheat grain uptake and soil bioavailability of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). Key findings suggest that organic matter management, specifically compost use, has a significant impact on both soil and grain Cd concentrations, with higher concentrations observed in organic farms with compost and livestock. However, for Zn, no significant farming system effect was observed, although there was a correlation between soil and grain Zn when all farms were pooled. The study highlights the role of soil organic matter in mediating both Zn and Cd soil and grain concentrations, and suggests that under agricultural field conditions, farming systems are a minor factor in increasing grain Zn. Livestock production intensity also plays a role in Cd uptake by wheat grains. Overall, the study underscores the importance of organic matter management, soil properties, and livestock production intensity in determining soil and grain concentrations of Zn and Cd.","
In relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this abstract touches on a few areas that could potentially contribute to several SDGs. Here are some relevant points:

SDG 2: Zero Hunger
The study highlights the importance of wheat grains as a major source of Zn for human nutrition, particularly in large parts of the human population. This underscores the need to ensure access to nutritious food, which is a key component of SDG 2.

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
The study also highlights the potential health risks associated with high levels of Cd in wheat grains. Cd is a toxic heavy metal that can cause a range of health problems, including kidney and liver damage, and is classified as a human carcinogen. Therefore, reducing Cd levels in wheat grains is crucial for promoting good health and well-being, which is a core objective of SDG 3.

SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
The study touches on the role of organic matter management in mediating both Zn and Cd soil and grain concentrations. This highlights the importance of sustainable agricultural practices, as they can have a significant impact on water quality and contribute to SDG 6.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

SDG 15: Life on Land
The study suggests that organic matter management, specifically compost use, has a significant impact on soil and grain concentrations of Zn and Cd. This underscores the importance of sustainable land use practices, which is a key objective of SDG 15.

In terms of implications for any of the SDGs, this study underscores the importance of sustainable agricultural practices, particularly with regard to organic matter management and livestock production intensity. By promoting these practices, it is possible to reduce health risks associated with high levels of Cd in wheat grains, promote responsible production and consumption patterns, and ensure sustainable land use practices, all of which are crucial for achieving several SDGs. Furthermore, by highlighting the role of organic matter management in mediating both Zn and Cd soil and grain concentrations, this study","
SDG 2: Zero Hunger
The study's findings regarding the impact of organic and conventional farming practices on wheat grain uptake of Zn and Cd have implications for achieving SDG 2: Zero Hunger. Zinc is essential for human health and plays a crucial role in preventing stunted growth and cognitive impairment in children. The study suggests that under agricultural field conditions, farming systems are a minor factor in increasing grain Zn, indicating that both organic and conventional farming practices can contribute to Zn availability and uptake by wheat grains. This is particularly relevant in areas where wheat is a major source of Zn intake, as it can help ensure that populations have access to adequate Zn intake to prevent malnutrition.

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that can lead to various health problems, including kidney damage, osteoporosis, and cancer. The study reveals that organic farming practices involving compost use can result in higher grain Cd concentrations, particularly when livestock is involved. This finding highlights the importance of managing organic matter in a way that minimizes Cd uptake by wheat grains to prevent health risks associated with Cd exposure.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The study's results also have implications for SDG 15: Life on Land, as they demonstrate the significant impact of organic matter management on soil and grain concentrations of Zn and Cd. Organic matter plays a crucial role in mediating both Zn and Cd soil and grain concentrations, and the study suggests that organic matter management should be carefully considered to ensure sustainable agriculture practices. Additionally, the study highlights the role of livestock production intensity in Cd uptake by wheat grains, underscoring the importance of responsible livestock management to minimize Cd contamination in agricultural products.

Overall, the study's findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of organic and conventional farming practices on soil and grain concentrations of essential micronutrients and toxic heavy metals, as well as the role of organic matter management and livestock production intensity in achieving sustainable agriculture practices and preventing health risks associated with heavy metal exposure.","

Diet and lifestyle have a strong influence on gut microbiota, which in turn has important implications on a variety of health-related aspects. Despite great advances in the field, it remains unclear to which extent the composition of the gut microbiota is modulated by the intake of animal derived products, compared to a vegetable based diet. Here the specific impact of vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore feeding type on the composition of gut microbiota of 101 adults was investigated among groups homogeneous for variables known to have a role in modulating gut microbial composition such as age, anthropometric variables, ethnicity, and geographic area. The results displayed a picture where the three different dietetic profiles could be well distinguished on the basis of participant’s dietetic regimen. Regarding the gut microbiota; vegetarians had a significantly greater richness compared to omnivorous. Moreover, counts of Bacteroidetes related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were greater in vegans and vegetarians compared to omnivores. Interestingly considering the whole bacterial community composition the three cohorts were unexpectedly similar, which is probably due to their common intake in terms of nutrients rather than food, e.g., high fat content and reduced protein and carbohydrate intake. This finding suggests that fundamental nutritional choices such as vegan, vegetarian, or omnivore do influence the microbiota but do not allow to infer conclusions on gut microbial composition, and suggested the possibility for a preferential impact of other variables, probably related to the general life style on shaping human gut microbial community in spite of dietary influence. Consequently, research were individuals are categorized on the basis of their claimed feeding types is of limited use for scientific studies, since it appears to be oversimplified.",3,"
The abstract examines the influence of different dietary styles, including vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore diets, on the gut microbiota of 101 adults. The study controlled for factors such as age, anthropometric variables, ethnicity, and geographic area to investigate the specific impact of diet on gut microbiota composition. The results showed that vegetarians had a greater gut microbiota richness than omnivores, and both vegans and vegetarians had higher counts of Bacteroidetes-related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than omnivores. However, despite significant differences in dietary regimens, the three cohorts had similar gut microbiota compositions due to their shared intake of high-fat content and reduced protein and carbohydrate intake. The study suggests that fundamental nutritional choices such as vegan, vegetarian, or omnivore do influence the gut microbiota but that other lifestyle factors may have a greater impact on shaping human gut microbial communities. The authors caution that research categorizing individuals based on their claimed feeding types is of limited use for scientific studies, as it appears oversimplified.","

SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
The development of efficient and economical water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) for artificial photosynthesis applications, as discussed in the abstract, has the potential to contribute to SDG 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Artificial photosynthesis is a promising technology that could provide a sustainable and renewable source of clean energy by converting sunlight into hydrogen fuel. The development of WOCs, which are a crucial component of artificial photosynthesis, would therefore contribute to the advancement of clean and renewable energy sources, promoting a sustainable and low-carbon future.

SDG 15: Life on Land
Although not immediately apparent, the development of WOCs could also contribute to SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and wildlife. This may seem like a stretch, but the production of hydrogen fuel through artificial photosynthesis could potentially replace fossil fuels, which contribute to deforestation and habitat destruction through land use changes. By reducing the demand for fossil fuels, the development of WOCs could contribute to preserving natural habitats and promoting sustainable land use practices. 

However, it is essential to be critical and objective when assessing the relevance of an abstract to specific SDGs. While the development of WOCs for artificial photosynthesis has the potential to contribute to SDGs 7 and 15, it is not a direct or explicit contribution. The main focus of the abstract is on the development of WOCs, and the potential contribution to SDGs 7 and 15 is indirect and implicit.

It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide1. Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities2. However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50% during climate events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16–32 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25%. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high- and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability14, and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.",15,"

Urban growth is a major factor of global environmental change and has important impacts on biodiversity, such as changes in species composition and biotic homogenization.
Most previous studies have focused on effects of urban area as a general measure of urbanization, and on few or single taxa. Here, we analyzed the impacts of the different components of urban sprawl (i.e., scattered and widespread urban growth) on species richness of a variety of taxonomic groups covering mosses, vascular plants, gastropods, butterflies, and birds at the habitat and landscape scales. Besides urban area, we considered the average age,imperviousness, and dispersion degree of urban area, along with human population density, to disentangle the effects of the different components of urban sprawl on biodiversity. The study was carried out in the Swiss Plateau that has undergone substantial urban sprawl in recent decades.
Vascular plants and birds showed the strongest responses to urban sprawl, especially at the landscape scale, with non-native and ruderal plants proliferating and common generalist birds increasing at the expense of specialist birds as urban sprawl grew. Overall, urban area had the greatest contribution on such impacts, but additional effects of urban dispersion (i.e., increase of non-native plants) and human population density (i.e., increases of ruderal plants and common generalist birds) were found.

Given the importance of employment in these fields for research and innovation, we consider their role in a model featuring endogenous non-routine-biased technical change. We use this model to quantify the impact of high-skilled immigration, and the increasing tendency of such immigrants to work in innovation, on the pace of non-routine-biased technical change, the polarization of employment opportunities, and the evolution of wage inequality since 1980.",8,"
The abstract explores the impact of high-skilled immigration, particularly in STEM occupations, on technical change, employment polarization, and wage inequality since 1980. The study considers the role of foreign-born workers in a model that includes endogenous non-routine-biased technical change. The main findings suggest that high-skilled immigration and the increasing tendency of such immigrants to work in innovation contribute to the acceleration of non-routine-biased technical change, which leads to a decrease in routine tasks and an increase in high-skilled employment in STEM fields. This, in turn, results in employment polarization, where low-skilled jobs become more routine-biased and high-skilled jobs become less so. The study also reveals that these trends contribute to the evolution of wage inequality since 1980, as high-skilled workers benefit from higher wages due to the increased demand for their skills in STEM fields.","
The provided abstract focuses on the impact of high-skilled immigration, particularly in STEM occupations, on technical change, employment polarization, and wage inequality since 1980. The study takes into account the role of foreign-born workers in a model that includes endogenous non-routine-biased technical change. 

The abstract highlights the following implications related to the SDGs:

SDG 4: Quality Education: The study shows that high-skilled immigration leads to an increase in high-skilled employment in STEM fields, which may indicate a positive impact on the provision of quality education and the promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all.

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth: The study suggests that high-skilled immigration and the increasing tendency of such immigrants to work in innovation contribute to the acceleration of non-routine-biased technical change, which results in employment opportunities in STEM fields. This may indicate a positive impact on decent work and economic growth.

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities: The study reveals that high-skilled immigration and the increasing tendency of such immigrants to work in innovation lead to employment polarization, where low-skilled jobs become more routine-biased and high-skilled jobs become less so. This may indicate a negative impact on reduced inequalities, as it could worsen the gap between high-skilled and low-skilled workers.

SDG 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The study implies that the trends related to high-skilled immigration and non-routine-biased technical change could impact the evolution of wage inequality since 1980, as high-skilled workers benefit from higher wages due to the increased demand for their skills in STEM fields. This may indicate a potential impact on the provision of access to justice for all and the establishment of effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

Overall, the study suggests a complex relationship between high-skilled immigration, non-routine-biased technical change, employment polarization, and wage inequality since 1980. While the study indicates potential positive impacts on quality education, decent work, and economic growth, it also highlights potential negative impacts on reduced inequalities and peace and justice strong institutions. Further research and policy actions should consider these implications and address the potential trade-offs","
SDG 5: Gender Equality
The abstract does not directly address SDG 5 as it focuses on the impact of high-skilled immigration, particularly in STEM occupations, on technical change, employment polarization, and wage inequality since 1980. There is no explicit mention of how this study contributes to promoting gender equality in STEM fields. However, in general, promoting gender equality in STEM fields can contribute to achieving SDG 5 by increasing the number of women in STEM occupations, which can lead to better outcomes in terms of technical change, employment, and wage inequality. Therefore, the study's findings on the impact of high-skilled immigration on employment and wage inequality in STEM fields can indirectly contribute to SDG 5, as it provides insights into the factors that affect gender equality in STEM occupations.

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
The study's findings suggest that high-skilled immigration, particularly in STEM occupations, contributes to the acceleration of non-routine-biased technical change, which leads to a decrease in routine tasks and an increase in high-skilled employment in STEM fields. This, in turn, results in employment polarization, where low-skilled jobs become more routine-biased and high-skilled jobs become less so. The study's findings align with SDG 8's objective to promote decent work and economic growth by creating high-skilled employment opportunities in STEM fields, which can contribute to economic growth and reduce income inequality.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals
The study's methodology involves using a model that includes endogenous non-routine-biased technical change to quantify the impact of high-skilled immigration, and the increasing tendency of such immigrants to work in innovation, on the pace of non-routine-biased technical change, the polarization of employment opportunities, and the evolution of wage inequality since 1980. This approach highlights the importance of partnerships and collaborations among researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to develop evidence-based policies that promote high-skilled immigration, particularly in STEM fields, while also addressing employment polarization and wage inequality. This aligns with SDG 17's objective to promote partnerships for achieving the SDGs.

117,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157088,"A cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of an individual planning intervention with collaborative planning in adolescent friendship dyads to enhance physical activity (TWOgether)
BACKGROUND: Most adolescents do not meet the recommendations for physical activity (PA) of at least 1 h per day. Individual planning (IP) interventions, including forming plans for when, where and how (action planning) to engage in a behavior, as well as the planning for how to deal with arising barriers (coping planning), are effective to enhance PA in adults. Collaborative planning (CP) is conjoint planning of two individuals regarding a behavior which is performed together. It is assumed that CP stimulates social exchange processes between the planning partners. However, it remains unclear whether planning interventions of PA in adolescents are successful and which planning intervention is more effective. Thus, this cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines changes in daily moderate-to-vigorous PA in adolescents' friendship dyads resulting from planning. Individual self-regulating mechanism and social exchange processes are proposed as mediating mechanisms of the effects of planning for health behavior change.

METHODS: A single-blind four-arm parallel-group cluster-RCT is used. The sample consists of 400 friendship dyads between 14 and 18 years of age. As the recruitment takes place in schools, a cluster randomization of the schools is used to enroll dyads to (a) an IP intervention, (b) a CP intervention or (c) one of the two no-planning control conditions. Devise-measured and self-reported PA as the primary outcomes, self-regulatory strategies, and social exchange processes as secondary outcomes are assessed at three or four time points. After baseline measurement, the baseline ecological momentary assessment of the main variables takes place for 8 days followed by the intervention and a 7-days diary phase. Follow-ups are 1 month and 6 months later. Subsequent to the six-month follow-up, another 7-days diary phase takes place.

DISCUSSION: This is the first study examining IP in comparison to CP in adolescents applying a single-blind cluster RCT. Consequently, the study allows for understanding the efficacy of individual and collaborative planning and the underlying mechanisms in adolescent dyads.

TRIAL REGISTRATION: This RCT was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (100019_169781/1) and was registered on 18/06/2018 at ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT03575559 .",3,"
The abstract presented describes a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of individual planning (IP) and collaborative planning (CP) in enhancing physical activity (PA) in adolescent friendship dyads. The study aims to examine changes in daily moderate-to-vigorous PA resulting from planning, as well as the role of self-regulating mechanisms and social exchange processes in the effects of planning for health behavior change. The trial consists of 400 friendship dyads between the ages of 14 and 18, with schools being randomly assigned to one of four groups: an IP intervention, a CP intervention, or one of two no-planning control conditions. Devise-measured and self-reported PA, as well as secondary outcomes such as self-regulatory strategies and social exchange processes, will be assessed at multiple time points over a seven-day intervention and follow-up periods. This is the first RCT to compare IP and CP in adolescents and will provide insights into the efficacy of individual and collaborative planning in this population. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03575559).","
The provided abstract relates to several SDGs, specifically SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 4 (Quality Education). The study aims to enhance physical activity (PA) in adolescents, which is essential for promoting good health and well-being (SDG 3). Additionally, the study involves adolescents in friendship dyads, highlighting the importance of quality education (SDG 4) in promoting healthy behaviors and lifestyle choices.

The study design involves a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with schools being randomly assigned to one of four groups. The intervention involves either individual planning (IP) or collaborative planning (CP), with both interventions aiming to increase daily moderate-to-vigorous PA in adolescents. The study will also examine the underlying mechanisms, such as self-regulating strategies and social exchange processes, that facilitate behavior change.

The study's findings will provide insights into the efficacy of individual and collaborative planning in adolescents, which is relevant to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). By promoting healthy behaviors and lifestyle choices, this study can contribute to reducing healthcare costs and promoting sustainable consumption patterns.

In summary, the study's focus on promoting healthy behaviors and lifestyle choices aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 4 (Quality Education). The study's design and methodology also highlight the importance of collaborative and individual planning in promoting sustainable consumption patterns, aligning with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).","
SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being

The proposed study has a direct relevance to SDG 3, as it aims to enhance physical activity (PA) in adolescents, which is a crucial component of overall health and well-being. Regular PA has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as improve mental health outcomes such as reduced stress and anxiety. By promoting PA through planning interventions, this study contributes to achieving SDG 3's target of reducing premature deaths from non-communicable diseases by one-third by 2030.

SDG 15: Life on Land

Although less apparent, this study's contribution to SDG 15, Life on Land, should not be overlooked. Physical inactivity, which is prevalent among adolescents, can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and a lack of connection to nature. In turn, this can negatively impact mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety, which can further deter adolescents from engaging in outdoor activities. By promoting PA through planning interventions, this study can potentially contribute to SDG 15's goal of protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and wildlife by encouraging adolescents to connect with nature through outdoor PA activities.

In conclusion, the proposed study's contribution to both SDG 3 and SDG 15 highlights the importance of addressing health and well-being concerns in the context of sustainable development. By promoting PA through planning interventions, this study can contribute to achieving multiple SDGs simultaneously, demonstrating the interconnectedness and importance of addressing these issues holistically.","

118,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168830,"Sex differences in intrusive memories following trauma
BACKGROUND: A key mechanism thought to underlie Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is enhanced emotional memory consolidation. Recent evidence in healthy controls revealed that women have greater negative memory consolidation following stress relative to men. This study examined emotional memory consolidation in women and men with PTSD, and in trauma-exposed and non-trauma controls to test the hypothesis that emotionally negative memory consolidation would be greater in women with PTSD.

METHOD: One hundred and forty-seven men and women (47 with PTSD, 49 trauma-exposed controls, and 51 non-trauma controls) completed an emotional memory task where they looked at negative, neutral and positive images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Delayed recall and an intrusive memory diary were completed two days later.

RESULTS: Women displayed greater recall, and reported more negative intrusive memories than men. A gender x group interaction effect showed that both women with PTSD and trauma-exposed women reported more intrusive memories than women without trauma exposure or men.

CONCLUSION: This study provided preliminary evidence of sex differences in intrusive memories in those with PTSD as well as those with a history of trauma exposure. Future research should include measures of sex hormones to further examine sex differences on memory consolidation in the context of trauma exposure and PTSD.",16,"
The abstract presented explores the theme of sex differences in emotional memory consolidation, specifically in relation to trauma and PTSD. The study's goal is to test the hypothesis that women with PTSD have greater negative memory consolidation compared to men. To achieve this, the abstract outlines a methodology involving an emotional memory task with negative, neutral, and positive images, followed by delayed recall and an intrusive memory diary completed two days later. The results revealed that women displayed greater recall and reported more negative intrusive memories than men, with both women with PTSD and trauma-exposed women reporting more intrusive memories than women without trauma exposure or men. The study's conclusion suggests that this finding provides preliminary evidence of sex differences in intrusive memories in those with PTSD as well as those with a history of trauma exposure. Future research should include measures of sex hormones to further examine sex differences on memory consolidation in the context of trauma exposure and PTSD.","
This abstract relates to SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being, as it explores the relationship between sex, trauma, and PTSD, specifically the impact of trauma and PTSD on emotional memory consolidation in women and men. The study's findings could have implications for understanding the unique challenges that women with PTSD face in managing intrusive memories, as well as the potential for different memory consolidation patterns in women with a history of trauma exposure. This knowledge could inform the development of tailored interventions and treatments for women with PTSD, in line with SDG 3's focus on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all. Additionally, the study's methodology and focus on sex differences aligns with SDG 5 - Gender Equality, as it highlights the importance of considering gender in research and healthcare practices.","
SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.

The abstract does not directly contribute to SDG 16, as it does not address issues of peace, justice, or institutional building. However, it does touch upon the theme of trauma, which can have a significant impact on individuals and societies, highlighting the need for access to healthcare and support systems to address the psychological and emotional consequences of trauma.

SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and habitat loss.

Again, the abstract does not appear to have a direct correlation with SDG 15. However, it does touch upon the importance of understanding and addressing the psychological impact of trauma, which could indirectly contribute to a better understanding of how individuals respond to environmental stressors, potentially influencing efforts to protect and manage ecosystems.

In conclusion, while the abstract does not explicitly relate to either SDG 16 or SDG 15, it does touch upon themes that could indirectly contribute to these goals by promoting access to healthcare and support systems for trauma survivors, and by highlighting the need for a better understanding of how individuals respond to environmental stressors. As such, it could be argued that the study's findings could have wider implications for promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, and for protecting and managing terrestrial ecosystems in a sustainable manner. However, the relevance of these connections is somewhat tenuous and should be considered as speculative rather than definitive.","

During the last decennia media environments and political communication systems have changed fundamentally. These changes have major ramifications for the political information environments and the extent to which they aid people in becoming informed citizens. Against this background, the purpose of this article is to review research on key changes and trends in political information environments and assess their democratic implications. We will focus on advanced postindustrial democracies and six concerns that are all closely linked to the dissemination and acquisition of political knowledge: (1) declining supply of political information, (2) declining quality of news, (3) increasing media concentration and declining diversity of news, (4) increasing fragmentation and polarization, (5) increasing relativism and (6) increasing inequality in political knowledge.",16,"
The abstract ""Political Communication in a High-Choice Media Environment: A Challenge for Democracy?"" explores the impact of recent transformations in media environments and political communication systems on the dissemination and acquisition of political knowledge. The study focuses on advanced postindustrial democracies and examines six key concerns related to political information: (1) declining supply of political information, (2) declining quality of news, (3) increasing media concentration and declining diversity of news, (4) increasing fragmentation and polarization, (5) increasing relativism, and (6) increasing inequality in political knowledge. The article aims to assess the democratic implications of these changes and trends.","
This abstract touches upon several core themes related to sustainable development and the SDGs, particularly SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions and SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals. 

Firstly, the declining supply of political information and the declining quality of news can negatively impact SDG 16 by undermining the flow of accurate and impartial information, making it harder for citizens to make informed decisions and hold their governments accountable. This, in turn, can hinder the development of strong institutions, as citizens may be less engaged and less likely to participate in democratic processes.

Secondly, the increasing media concentration and declining diversity of news can hinder SDG 17 by limiting the range of perspectives and ideas presented in the media, reducing opportunities for partnerships and collaborations. This can also lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, as monopolies can use their power to manipulate the media landscape to suit their own interests.

Thirdly, the increasing fragmentation and polarization in media can lead to a lack of consensus and cohesion in society, which can negatively impact SDG 16 by hindering the development of peaceful and inclusive societies. This can also contribute to the rise of extremism and populism, which can further erode the democratic process.

Lastly, the increasing inequality in political knowledge can undermine SDG 16 and SDG 4 by disproportionately affecting marginalized communities and limiting their access to information and opportunities for political participation. This can also hinder the development of strong institutions, as less informed citizens may be less able to hold their governments accountable.

Overall, the themes explored in this abstract highlight the importance of ensuring access to accurate and diverse information, promoting transparency and accountability, and addressing inequality in political knowledge and participation. These themes are closely related to SDG 16 and SDG 17, and their implementation is crucial for building peaceful, inclusive, and sustainable societies.","
SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

The abstract highlights the importance of political knowledge for informed decision-making and civic engagement, which is crucial for promoting peaceful and inclusive societies. The study's focus on declining supply of political information, declining quality of news, and increasing media concentration and inequality in political knowledge indicates a potential threat to access to justice and the ability of citizens to hold their institutions accountable. The findings of this study could inform policies aimed at promoting media literacy, supporting independent journalism, and ensuring diverse and high-quality news sources, which can contribute to building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.

The abstract touches on the global nature of media environments and political communication systems, which highlights the importance of international cooperation in addressing the challenges and implications of these changes. The study's focus on advanced postindustrial democracies implies a call for a multi-level approach to promoting political knowledge and media literacy, which requires partnerships between governments, civil society, and the private sector. The findings of this study could inform international policies aimed at supporting media freedom, promoting media literacy, and addressing media concentration and inequality, which can contribute to strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development.

In conclusion, the abstract's relevance to SDGs 16 and 17 is critical and objective. While there is potential overlap with other SDGs related to education, peace, and justice, the focus on political knowledge and media literacy is particularly relevant to these two SDGs. The study's findings could inform policies aimed at promoting peaceful and inclusive societies and strengthening international partnerships, which align with the goals of these two SDGs.","
The abstract ""Political Communication in a High-Choice Media Environment: A Challenge for Democracy?"" raises concerns related to the dissemination and acquisition of political knowledge in advanced postindustrial democracies. The study explores six key themes, including declining supply and quality of political information, increasing media concentration and fragmentation, and increasing inequality in political knowledge. These themes have implications for SDGs 16 and 17, as they can hinder the development of peaceful and inclusive societies and strong institutions, as well as limit access to justice and opportunities for political participation. To address these challenges, policies promoting media literacy, supporting independent journalism, and ensuring diverse and high-quality news sources should be implemented, as well as international cooperation to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.","
Based on the insights provided, the abstract's contributions towards the SDGs can be ranked as follows:

SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The abstract touches upon themes related to access to justice and opportunities for political participation, which are crucial elements for building peaceful and inclusive societies and strong institutions. The study's findings highlight the need to address issues related to declining supply and quality of political information, increasing media concentration and fragmentation, and increasing inequality in political knowledge to ensure equal access to information and opportunities for political participation.

SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: The insights provided also highlight the importance of international cooperation in addressing these challenges. The study suggests the need for international cooperation to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development, as these issues are not limited to individual countries but rather require a coordinated effort at the global level.

SDG 0 - No Goal: Must be chosen if and only if the abstract does not contribute to any of the SDGs. While the study does not explicitly address all the SDGs, it does touch upon themes related to SDGs 3, 4, and 11, which are indirectly related to the dissemination and acquisition of political knowledge. However, the study's focus is primarily on understanding the democratic implications of these trends rather than directly addressing these SDGs, and as such, we cannot conclude that the abstract makes a significant contribution towards these SDGs.

It is essential to note that while the study touches upon themes related to these SDGs, there is a need for further research to fully understand the implications of these trends on the SDGs and develop policies that address these challenges. Therefore, while the study's findings contribute towards SDGs 16 and 17, it is crucial to continue studying the impacts of these trends on the SDGs and develop policies that address these challenges holistically.","

Two seemingly associated demographic trends have generated considerable interest: income stagnation and rising premature mortality from suicides, drug poisoning, and alcoholic liver disease among US non-Hispanic Whites with low education. Economists interpret these population-level trends to indicate that despair induced by financial stressors is a shared pathway to these causes of death. Although we now have the catchy term ""deaths of despair,"" we have yet to study its central empirical claim: that conceptually defined and empirically assessed ""despair"" is indeed a common pathway to several causes of death. At the level of the person, despair consists of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and biological domains. Despair can also permeate social relationships, networks, institutions, and communities. Extant longitudinal data sets feature repeated measures of despair-before, during, and after the Great Recession-offering resources to test the role that despair induced by economic decline plays in premature morbidity and mortality. Such tests must also focus on protective factors that could shield individuals.  is more than a phrase; it constitutes a hypothesis that deserves conceptual mapping and empirical study with longitudinal, multilevel data.",3,"
The abstract presents a research question about the relationship between income stagnation, rising premature mortality, and despair among US non-Hispanic Whites with low education. It suggests that economists interpret these trends as indicating that financial stressors lead to despair and premature death through suicide, drug poisoning, and alcoholic liver disease. The abstract highlights the need to test this hypothesis empirically using longitudinal data, specifically examining the role of despair induced by economic decline in premature morbidity and mortality while also exploring protective factors. The abstract emphasizes the multidimensional nature of despair, which includes cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and biological domains, as well as its social and communal dimensions. In summary, the core themes of this abstract are the relationship between income stagnation, rising premature mortality, and despair, the need for empirical testing of this hypothesis, and the multidimensional and social nature of despair.","
This abstract touches on SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) as it explores the relationship between income stagnation, rising premature mortality, and despair among US non-Hispanic Whites with low education. The research question highlights the impact of financial stressors on mental and physical health, which aligns with SDG 3's focus on promoting good health and well-being. The abstract also emphasizes the need for empirical testing of this relationship, which aligns with SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) as it calls for strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing global partnerships for sustainable development. By exploring the role of despair induced by economic decline in premature morbidity and mortality, the abstract sheds light on the social and economic inequalities that contribute to poor health outcomes, which is in line with SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). Overall, this abstract highlights the interconnectedness between poverty, health, and social inequality, and underscores the importance of addressing these issues to achieve sustainable development goals.","
SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
The abstract highlights a rising trend in premature mortality due to suicide, drug poisoning, and alcoholic liver disease among US non-Hispanic Whites with low education. This directly relates to SDG 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages. The research presented in the abstract intends to investigate the role of despair induced by economic decline in premature morbidity and mortality. By understanding the causal relationship between despair and premature death, the research can contribute to the development of interventions and policies to mitigate premature mortality, ultimately contributing to achieving SDG 3.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The abstract mentions that economists interpret the demographic trends as indicating that despair induced by financial stressors is a common pathway to suicide, drug poisoning, and alcoholic liver disease. However, the relevance to SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, is not immediately apparent. Upon further analysis, it can be argued that despair could potentially lead to environmental degradation and unsustainable land use practices. For instance, people experiencing despair may be less motivated to engage in environmental conservation efforts, which could negatively impact terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the role of despair in premature mortality could also help address SDG 15 by informing the development of interventions that promote environmental conservation and sustainable land use practices.

However, the contribution to SDG 15 is less direct than the contribution to SDG 3, and more research is required to establish the causal relationship between despair and environmental degradation. Thus, while SDG 15 is not irrelevant to this research, its contribution is less evident compared to SDG 3.

In conclusion, the research presented in the abstract has a more significant relevance to SDG 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages, compared to SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the research could potentially contribute to achieving SDG 15 by informing interventions that promote environmental conservation and sustainable land use practices, although further research is required to establish the causal relationship between despair and environmental degradation.","

Since the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850, the total glacier area of the central European Alps has considerably decreased. In order to understand the changes in glacier coverage at various scales and to model past and future streamflow accurately, long-term and large-scale datasets of glacier outlines are needed. To fill the gap between the morphologically reconstructed glacier outlines from the moraine extent corresponding to the time period around 1850 and the first complete dataset of glacier areas in the Swiss Alps from aerial photographs in 1973, glacier areas from 80 sheets of a historical topographic map (the Siegfried map) were manually digitized for the publication years 1878–1918 (further called first period, with most sheets being published around 1900) and 1917–1944 (further called second period, with most sheets being published around 1935). The accuracy of the digitized glacier areas was then assessed through a two-step validation process: the data were (1) visually and (2) quantitatively compared to glacier area datasets of the years 1850, 1973, 2003, and 2010, which were derived from different sources, at the large scale, basin scale, and locally. The validation showed that at least 70 % of the digitized glaciers were comparable to the outlines from the other datasets and were therefore plausible.

Additionally, the abstract's emphasis on the need for long-term and large-scale datasets of glacier outlines can contribute to achieving SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by facilitating the development of more accurate and sustainable infrastructure for water resources management in the Swiss Alps.

Overall, the manual digitization of historical glacier outlines can provide crucial insights for achieving several SDGs, particularly SDG 6, SDG 13, and SDG 9.","
SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
While the abstract does not explicitly mention SDG 6, it touches upon the importance of glacier coverage changes in glacierized basins for understanding streamflow and water management. Accurate modeling of past and future streamflow is crucial for ensuring access to clean water and sanitation in these areas, particularly in light of the increasing impacts of climate change on glaciers. Therefore, the creation of historical datasets of glacier outlines can contribute to SDG 6 by providing essential information for effective water resource management.

SDG 13: Climate Action
The abstract highlights the significant decrease in total glacier area since the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850, which is a direct consequence of climate change. By providing historical datasets of glacier outlines, researchers can better understand the changes in glacier coverage at various scales and contribute to efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change on glaciers and water resources. Thus, the creation of these datasets can indirectly support SDG 13.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The abstract focuses on the creation of historical datasets of glacier outlines in Switzerland, which can contribute to efforts to conserve and protect glaciers as important components of the natural environment. Accurate modeling of glacier mass balance and streamflow is crucial for effective management of glacierized basins, which can help prevent landslides and reduce the risk of glacial lake outburst floods. Therefore, the creation of historical datasets of glacier outlines can indirectly support SDG 15 by contributing to effective glacier management and conservation efforts.

Overall, the abstract's contribution to the suggested SDGs is indirect, as it does not directly address these goals but rather provides information that can support them. However, the creation of historical datasets of glacier outlines is a critical step towards understanding the impacts of climate change on glaciers and water resources, as well as managing glacierized basins effectively.

122,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170221,"Modeling the spatial dependence of floods using the Fisher copula
Floods often affect not only a single location, but also a whole region. Flood frequency analysis should therefore be undertaken at a regional scale which requires the considerations of the dependence of events at different locations. This dependence is often neglected even though its consideration is essential to derive reliable flood estimates. A model used in regional multivariate frequency analysis should ideally consider the dependence of events at multiple sites which might show dependence in the lower and/or upper tail of the distribution. We here seek to propose a simple model that on the one hand considers this dependence with respect to the network structure of the region and on the other hand allows for the simulation of stochastic event sets at both gauged and ungauged locations. The new Fisher copula model is used for representing the spatial dependence of flood events in the nested Thur catchment in Switzerland. Flood event samples generated for the gauged stations using the Fisher copula are compared to samples generated by other dependence models allowing for modeling of multivariate data including elliptical copulas, R-vine copulas, and max-stable models. The comparison of the dependence structures of the generated samples shows that the Fisher copula is a suitable model for capturing the spatial dependence in the data. We therefore use the copula in a way such that it can be used in an interpolation context to simulate event sets comprising gauged and ungauged locations. The spatial event sets generated using the Fisher copula well capture the general dependence structure in the data and the upper tail dependence, which is of particular interest when looking at extreme flood events and when extrapolating to higher return periods. The Fisher copula was for a medium-sized catchment found to be a suitable model for the stochastic simulation of flood event sets at multiple gauged and ungauged locations.",15,"

Overall, the abstract suggests that the Fisher copula is a promising model for regional multivariate frequency analysis of flood events.","
Based on the provided abstract and core themes, the Fisher copula model proposed has potential implications for achieving several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) in the context of managing flood risks and reducing vulnerabilities.

SDG 13: Climate Action
The proposed Fisher copula model can contribute to achieving SDG 13 by facilitating more accurate and reliable flood estimates that take into account the spatial dependence of flood events. This is essential to combat climate change and its impacts, as flood risks are expected to increase due to climate change. The model can help in assessing and managing flood risks more effectively, particularly in regions that are prone to extreme flood events. Moreover, the Fisher copula can help in the simulation of stochastic event sets at ungauged locations, which can aid in identifying flood-prone areas and prioritizing infrastructure investments for mitigating flood risks.

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
The Fisher copula model can also contribute to achieving SDG 9 by enabling more informed infrastructure investments, particularly in the context of flood risk management. The model can help in designing flood management strategies that consider the spatial dependence of flood events and the network structure of the region. This can lead to more resilient infrastructure and improved flood management practices, which can contribute to achieving SDG 9's goal of promoting sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation. Moreover, the Fisher copula model can facilitate the development of more effective flood warning systems, which can help in reducing flood damages and mitigating economic losses, particularly in developing countries.

In summary, the proposed Fisher copula model has the potential to contribute to achieving SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by facilitating more accurate and reliable flood estimates, improving flood risk management practices, and enabling more informed infrastructure investments. The model's ability to consider the spatial dependence of flood events and the network structure of the region makes it a promising tool for managing flood risks in a more sustainable and resilient way.","

Background: Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant growth and associated C cycling have intensively been studied, but less is known about effects on the fluxes of radiatively active trace gases other than CO2. Net soil-atmosphere CH4 fluxes are determined by the balance of soil microbially-driven methane (CH4) oxidation and methanogenesis, and both might change under elevated CO2.
Methods and Results: Here, we studied CH4 dynamics in a permanent grassland exposed to elevated CO2 for 14 years. Soil-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 were measured using large static chambers, over a period of four years. The ecosystem was a net sink for atmospheric CH4 for most of the time except summer to fall when net CH4 emissions occurred. We did not detect any elevated CO2 effects on CH4 fluxes, but emissions were difficult to quantify due to their discontinuous nature, most likely because of ebullition from the saturated zone. Potential methanotrophic activity, determined by incubation of fresh sieved soil under standardized conditions, also did not reveal any effect of the CO2 treatment. Finally, we determined the spatial micro-distribution of methanotrophic activity at less than 5× atmospheric (10 ppm) and elevated (10000 ppm) CH4 concentrations, using a novel auto-radiographic technique. These analyses indicated that domains of net CH4 assimilation were distributed throughout the analyzed top 15 cm of soils, with no dependence on CH4 concentration or CO2 treatment.
Conclusions: Our investigations suggest that elevated CO2 exerts no or only minor effects on CH4 fluxes in the type of ecosystem we studied, at least as long as soil moisture differences are small or absent as was the case here. The autoradiographic analyses further indicate that the spatial niche of CH4 oxidation does not shift in response to CO2 enrichment or CH4 concentration, and that the same type of methanotrophs may oxidize CH4 from atmospheric and soil-internal sources.",13,"
The abstract explores the impact of long-term CO2 enrichment on soil-atmosphere CH4 fluxes and the spatial distribution of methanotrophic bacteria in a permanent grassland. The study found that the ecosystem was a net sink for atmospheric CH4 for most of the time, but emissions occurred during summer to fall due to ebullition from the saturated zone. The researchers did not detect any effect of CO2 enrichment on CH4 fluxes, but quantification was difficult due to their discontinuous nature.

Therefore, this study's findings could have indirect implications for SDG 13 - Climate Action, which aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. By understanding the impact of CO2 enrichment on CH4 fluxes and the spatial distribution of methanotrophic bacteria, we can better understand how CH4 emissions may change under elevated CO2 concentrations, which is crucial for developing mitigation strategies to reduce CH4 emissions. However, more research is needed to confirm the generality of these findings and how they can be applied to other ecosystems and land-use types, as the study's results may not be applicable to all types of ecosystems.","

Methods: Data were collected among 922 dyads of parents (mean age 35.97 years old; 83.9% women) and children (aged 6–11; M = 8.42, 52% girls). Parents and children reported safety and accessibility perceptions (Time 1) and PA (Time 1 and 2). Parental and child body fat were measured objectively (Time 1 and 2).

Results: Path analysis showed that parental perceptions of accessibility of PA facilities for children (Time 1) predicted child body fat and PA (Time 2). The associations were significant in a model accounting for longitudinal and cross-sectional associations between parental and child body fat and PA, controlling for age and gender of parents and children. Similar patterns of associations were found in the subsamples of dyads with children with normal body weight and with children with overweight/obesity.

Conclusions: Parental, not child perceptions of accessibility of PA facilities predicted child PA and body fat.",3,"
The abstract outlines a study investigating the relationship between parental and child perceptions of physical activity (PA) facilities, PA, and body fat percentage in children aged 6-11. The study employed a prospective and dyadic design, with two measurement points seven to eight months apart. The results showed that parental perceptions of accessibility of PA facilities at baseline predicted child PA and body fat at the second measurement point, even after controlling for age and gender of both parents and children, and after accounting for longitudinal and cross-sectional associations between parental and child body fat and PA. Similar patterns of associations were found in subsamples of dyads with children with normal body weight and those with overweight/obesity. Overall, the study suggests that parental, not child, perceptions of accessibility of PA facilities play a significant role in predicting child PA and body fat.","

Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.",10,"

Species in extreme habitats increasingly face changes in seasonal climate, but the demographic mechanisms through which these changes affect population persistence remain unknown. We investigated how changes in seasonal rainfall and temperature influence vital rates and viability of an arid environment specialist, the Kalahari meerkat, through effects on body mass. We show that climate change–induced reduction in adult mass in the prebreeding season would decrease fecundity during the breeding season and increase extinction risk, particularly at low population densities. In contrast, a warmer nonbreeding season resulting in increased mass and survival would buffer negative effects of reduced rainfall during the breeding season, ensuring persistence.

BACKGROUND: The zoonotic parasite Taenia saginata transmits between humans, the definitive host (causing taeniosis), and bovines as the intermediate host (causing cysticercosis). Central and western Asia and the Caucasus have large cattle populations and beef consumption is widespread. However, an overview of the extent of human T. saginata infection and bovine cysticercosis is lacking. This review aims to summarize the distribution of T. saginata in this region.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, that gathered published and grey literature, and official data concerning T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis in central and western Asia and the Caucasus published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2018. Where no data were available for a country within this period, published data from 1985-1990 were also accessed.
RESULTS: From 10,786 articles initially scanned, we retrieved 98 full-text articles from which data were extracted. In addition, two unpublished datasets were provided on the incidence of human taeniosis. Data for human taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis were found for all countries except Turkmenistan. Human taeniosis prevalence varied from undetected to over 5.3%, with regional variations. Where bovine cysticercosis was detected, prevalences varied from case reports to 25%.
CONCLUSIONS: The public health burden of T. saginata is assumed to be small as the parasite is of low pathogenicity to humans. However, this review indicates that infection continues to be widespread and this may result in a large economic burden, due to the resources utilized in meat inspection and condemnation or processing with subsequent downgrading of infected carcasses.",3,"

Temporal autocorrelation in demographic processes is an important aspect of population dynamics, but a comprehensive examination of its effects on different life-history strategies is lacking. We use matrix population models from 454 plant and animal populations to simulate stochastic population growth rates (log λs) under different temporal autocorrelations in demographic rates, using simulated and observed covariation among rates. We then test for differences in sensitivities, or changes of log λs to changes in autocorrelation among two major axes of life-history strategies, obtained from phylogenetically informed principal component analysis: the fast-slow and reproductive-strategy continua. Fast life histories exhibit highest sensitivities to simulated autocorrelation in demographic rates across reproductive strategies. Slow life histories are less sensitive to temporal autocorrelation, but their sensitivities increase among highly iteroparous species. We provide cross-taxonomic evidence that changes in the autocorrelation of environmental variation may affect a wide range of species, depending on complex interactions of life-history strategies.",15,"
The abstract presents a study that investigates the impact of temporal autocorrelation on different life-history strategies in both plants and animals.

We document a new finding regarding changes in labor market outcomes for high-skilled men and women in the US. Since 1980, conditional on being a college-educated man, the probability of working in a cognitive/high-wage occupation has fallen. This contrasts starkly with the experience for college-educated women: their probability of working in these occupations rose, despite a much larger increase in the supply of educated women relative to men. We show that one key channel capable of rationalizing these findings is a greater increase in the demand for female-oriented skills in cognitive/high-wage occupations relative to other occupations. Using occupation-level data, we find evidence that this relative increase in the demand for female skills is due to an increasing importance of social skills within such occupations. Evidence from both male and female wages is also indicative of an increase in the demand for social skills. Finally, we document how these patterns change across the early and latter portions of the period.",5,"

Objectives: This study examines the influence of collective strain on support

This study explores two claims derived from general strain theory:
(1) Exposure to collective strain is associated with higher support for violent
extremism and (2) the effect of collective strain is conditional on
perceptions of moral and legal constraints. Methods: This study uses data
from two waves of the Zurich Project on the Social Development of Children
and Youth. We use ordinary least squares procedures to regress
violent extremist attitudes at age 17 on strain, moral and legal constraints,
and control variables measured at ages 15 to 17. Conditional effects were
examined using an interaction term for collective strain and moral neutralization
and legal cynicism, respectively. Results: The results show that collective
strain does not have a direct effect on violent extremist attitudes
once other variables are controlled. However, the degree to which individuals
neutralize moral and legal constraints amplifies the impact of collective

Understanding and quantifying the temperature dependence of population parameters, such as intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity, is critical for predicting the ecological responses to environmental change. Many studies provide empirical estimates of such temperature dependencies, but a thorough investigation of the methods used to infer them has not been performed yet. We created artificial population time series using a stochastic logistic model parameterized with the Arrhenius equation, so that activation energy drives the temperature dependence of population parameters. We simulated different experimental designs and used different inference methods, varying the likelihood functions and other aspects of the parameter estimation methods. Finally, we applied the best performing inference methods to real data for the species Paramecium caudatum. The relative error of the estimates of activation energy varied between 5% and 30%. The fraction of habitat sampled played the most important role in determining the relative error; sampling at least 1% of the habitat kept it below 50%. We found that methods that simultaneously use all time series data (direct methods) and methods that estimate population parameters separately for each temperature (indirect methods) are complementary. Indirect methods provide a clearer insight into the shape of the functional form describing the temperature dependence of population parameters; direct methods enable a more accurate estimation of the parameters of such functional forms. Using both methods, we found that growth rate and carrying capacity of Paramecium caudatum scale with temperature according to different activation energies. Our study shows how careful choice of experimental design and inference methods can increase the accuracy of the inferred relationships between temperature and population parameters. The comparison of estimation methods provided here can increase the accuracy of model predictions, with important implications in understanding and predicting the effects of temperature on the dynamics of populations.",14,"

Epidemiological data on the chronicity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in relation to trauma type and underlying pathways are rare. The current study explored how PTSD symptoms change over time across different trauma types and examined mediators of their persistence. A trauma-exposed community sample, whereof approximately one quarter met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, provided retrospective data on the duration of PTSD symptoms. Those who remitted and those who had not at the time of assessment were compared regarding worst trauma, symptom severity, comorbidity, demographic and treatment-seeking variables. Time to remission was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models including candidate predictors of remission. A mediated survival analysis was used to explore indirect pathways that explain trauma-specific differences in remission times. Both the full sample and PTSD subgroup were analyzed separately. Overall, lower socio-economic status, lifetime and childhood sexual trauma, symptom severity, comorbid depression and past treatment were associated with non- and longer remissions. PTSD avoidance symptoms and comorbid depression were found to mediate longer remission times after lifetime or childhood sexual trauma. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms and complicating factors of remission from PTSD symptoms after trauma, which might have important implications for therapeutic interventions.",16,"

In previous decades, women in Western countries have gained more influence in various social realms. The percentage of females in higher education, the workforce, boards at publicly traded companies and national parliaments has increased. However, substantial underrepresentation of women in political news has remained. To explain the reasons behind this gender imbalance in news content, we conducted a content analysis of different types of online news in six Western countries. In our study, we distinguish among three levels of analysis: (1) the story level (frequency and format), (2) the media organization level (popular vs mass and upmarket outlets) and (3) the societal level. The results indicate that female actors are most frequently covered by popular news outlets and are more likely to be depicted in a photograph. Furthermore, strong determinants of continued gender differences in political news were found at the country level. Specifically, coverage increases in countries where gender equality is progressing in major parts of society.",5,"

Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Bush administration established a security discourse based on the paradigm of ""uncertain threats,"" characterizing the ""war on terror"" as a war against the ""unknown."" From the point of view of this new security discourse, counterterrorism should not confine itself to the accumulation of data concerning the goals, strategies, and means of terrorist networks. It also depends on ingenuity on the part of security analysts in the imagination of possible present and future events. Besides analyzing facts, counterterrorism has to work speculatively through possibilities, to think in the subjunctive. Consequently, members of the Hollywood entertainment industry were invited by the Pentagon in October 2001 ""to brainstorm about possible terrorist targets and schemes in America and to offer solutions to those threats."" The present article argues that the consideration of fiction as potential fact is symptomatic of the discursive response to terror, which oscillates between the real (actual incidents of political violence) and the imaginary (anticipated further attacks), both drawing on and contributing to what I propose to conceptualize as the cultural imaginary of terrorism. Although this dynamic became particularly salient after 9/11, it has a much longer history, going back to the first emergence of sub-state violence against public targets at the close of the nineteenth century, when several literary writers devised spectacular scenarios of attacks from the air or with biological weapons. What distinguishes these late-Victorian fictions from post-9/11 counterterrorist discourse, however, is that the latter has made the imaginary an integral feature of homeland defense and thus a basis for political practice.",16,"
The abstract explores the cultural imaginary of terrorism, specifically in relation to the Bush administration's response to the September 11 attacks. It highlights the shift towards ""uncertain threats"" and the importance of imagination and speculation in counterterrorism efforts. The article argues that the consideration of fiction as potential fact is a symptom of this discursive response to terror, which oscillates between real incidents of political violence and anticipated further attacks. The concept of the cultural imaginary of terrorism is proposed as a way to understand this dynamic, which has a longer history dating back to late-Victorian fictions of attacks from the air or with biological weapons. The article contrasts these early fictions with post-9/11 counterterrorist discourse, which has integrated the imaginary into homeland defense and made it a basis for political practice. The methodology used involves analyzing discursive responses to terror, both factual incidents and anticipated further attacks, in order to understand the cultural imaginary of terrorism. The key finding is the importance of imagination and speculation in counterterrorism efforts, and the article concludes by proposing the concept of the cultural imaginary of terrorism as a way to understand this dynamic.","

SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.

The abstract discusses the discursive response to terror, which oscillates between real incidents of political violence and anticipated further attacks. It highlights the importance of imagination and speculation in counterterrorism efforts, which is related to promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. When the consideration of fiction as potential fact becomes an integral feature of homeland defense, as the article points out, it has the potential to build more effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. The abstract suggests that the cultural imaginary of terrorism can contribute to the development of more effective and inclusive institutions by fostering a broader understanding of the complex dynamics of terrorism and its potential threats. By integrating the imaginary into homeland defense and making it a basis for political practice, it may help to prevent further attacks and promote more inclusive societies.

SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.

The abstract also touches on SDG 17, as it discusses the collaboration between the Hollywood entertainment industry and the Pentagon in brainstorming potential terrorist targets and schemes in America. This partnership can be seen as a form of global partnership for sustainable development, as it involves international cooperation and knowledge-sharing in addressing the threats posed by terrorism. The article suggests that this collaboration can contribute to more effective homeland defense, as it draws on the imaginative and creative capacities of the entertainment industry to anticipate potential threats. By strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development in this way, it may be possible to better address the complex dynamics of terrorism and promote more sustainable and inclusive societies.

In summary, the abstract suggests that the cultural imaginary of terrorism can contribute to both SDG 16 and SDG 17 by fostering more effective and inclusive institutions at all levels, and by strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development in addressing the threats posed by terrorism.","

Hardly known twenty years ago, exclusion from public space has today become a standard tool of state intervention. Every year, tens of thousands of homeless individuals, drug addicts, teenagers, protesters and others are banned from parts of public space. The rise of exclusion measures is characteristic of two broader developments that have profoundly transformed public space in recent years: the privatisation of public space, and its increased control in the 'security society'. Despite the fundamental problems it raises, exclusion from public space has received hardly any attention from legal scholars. This book addresses this gap and comprehensively explores the implications that this new form of intervention has for the constitutional essentials of liberal democracy: the rule of law, fundamental rights, and democracy. To do so, it analyses legal developments in three liberal democracies that have been at the forefront of promoting exclusion measures: the United Kingdom, the United States, and Switzerland.",16,"

The study aims to fill the gap in legal scholarship regarding this issue.","
Although the provided abstract does not explicitly mention the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it touches upon a few SDGs indirectly. Here are some potential implications:

1. SDG 1 (No Poverty): The abstract mentions homeless individuals as being affected by exclusion measures. Homelessness is a significant issue in many countries, and exclusion from public spaces exacerbates the problem by denying access to essential resources such as public toilets, water fountains, and shelters. This can push people further into poverty, as they are unable to meet their basic needs.

2. SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities): The abstract notes that exclusion measures disproportionately affect marginalized groups, such as homeless individuals, drug addicts, and teenagers. These groups often face social and economic inequalities, and exclusion from public spaces further exacerbates their disadvantage. This raises questions about the fairness and equality of such measures and their impact on reducing inequalities in society.

3. SDG 16 (Peace and Justice Strong Institutions): The abstract highlights the need to analyze legal developments regarding exclusion measures in three liberal democracies (the UK, US, and Switzerland). This points to the importance of ensuring that such measures are implemented in a just and democratic manner, respecting the rule of law and fundamental rights. Failure to do so could undermine the legitimacy of these measures and the institutions responsible for implementing them.

4. SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals): The analysis presented in the abstract could contribute to partnerships for the SDGs by raising awareness of the impact of exclusion measures on poverty, inequality, and democracy. By exploring legal developments in different countries, the study could also help to identify best practices and challenges in implementing exclusion measures, informing policy-making and partnerships across different contexts.

In summary, although the abstract does not explicitly address the SDGs, it touches upon themes that are relevant to several of them, highlighting the need to ensure that exclusion measures are implemented in a just, democratic, and sustainable manner.","
SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.

The abstract highlights the fundamental problems raised by the rise of exclusion measures, which can negatively impact peaceful and inclusive societies. The analysis will explore the implications of these measures on democracy and access to justice, which are crucial elements of peaceful and inclusive societies. By examining legal developments in three countries, the study aims to promote accountability and inclusiveness in institutions dealing with public space issues. This alignment with SDG 16 is particularly relevant as exclusion from public space can exacerbate social and economic inequalities, leading to conflict and social exclusion.

SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.

The abstract touches upon the privatization of public space, which is a form of industrialization. The analysis will explore how exclusion measures impact the design and use of public spaces, and whether they contribute to sustainable and inclusive development. By identifying the implications of these measures for constitutional essentials, the study can contribute to more resilient and sustainable infrastructure that promotes social inclusion.

While the analysis will not directly address SDG 1, which calls for poverty eradication, it is relevant in the context that exclusion from public space can negatively impact marginalized populations, including homeless individuals and drug addicts. By examining legal developments in this area, the study can contribute to more inclusive and effective policies that address poverty and social exclusion.

It is important to note that while there is a superficial similarity between SDG 16 and 1, the former focuses on democratic governance and access to justice, while the latter addresses poverty eradication. The relevance of SDG 16 to this study is more direct and explicit, while the relevance of SDG 1 is indirect and contingent on the study's impact on marginalized populations.

In conclusion, the abstract is relevant to SDGs 16 and 9, as the analysis will explore the implications of exclusion measures on constitutional essentials and the design and use of public spaces, respectively. While there is a superficial similarity with SDG 1, its relevance is more contingent and indirect. It is crucial to remain critical and objective while assessing SDG relevance, without contrad","

In contrast to bulk materials and precious metals, the recovery of most critical metals has not yet been commercially established, and they are thus lost within the recycling process. In this article, we used dynamic material flow analysis to explore the stocks and flows of indium, neodymium, and gold incorporated in end-user devices in Switzerland. Our analysis covered the use, collection, recycling, and disposal phases. This enabled us to track the three metals from their entry into Switzerland as components of new devices until their recovery, disposal in landfills, or dissipation to the environment. Using statistical entropy analysis (SEA), we further analyzed the dilution or concentration of the metals during their route through the current system. The data uncertainty was addressed employing a probabilistic approach. The largest quantities of all three metals are found in the devices currently in use. The second-largest stocks are slags disposed in landfills for indium, slags used for construction for neodymium, and the output of metal recovery processes for gold. The SEA illustrates how the current collection and recycling system successfully concentrates all three metals. While 70% of gold leaving the use phase is recovered, indium and neodymium are dissipated to slags after smelting and incineration processes due to the lack of economic incentives and lacking recovery processes on a commercial scale.",12,"
The abstract explores the flows of three critical metals - indium, neodymium, and gold - associated with electronic equipment in Switzerland. Through dynamic material flow analysis, the authors track the metals from their entry into Switzerland as components of new devices until their recovery, disposal, or dissipation. The study covers the use, collection, recycling, and disposal phases. The results reveal that the largest stocks of these metals are currently in use, with the second-largest stocks found in slags disposed in landfills (indium), slags used for construction (neodymium), and the output of metal recovery processes (gold). Statistical entropy analysis (SEA) demonstrates that the current collection and recycling system concentrates all three metals, with 70% of gold being recovered, while indium and neodymium are dissipated due to a lack of economic incentives and the absence of commercial-scale recovery processes after smelting and incineration processes. The authors' approach addresses data uncertainty through a probabilistic approach. In summary, the study highlights the current waste streams generated by digital information and communications technologies (ICT) and the need for more effective recovery methods for critical metals beyond precious metals.","
The provided abstract focuses on sustainable development related to the responsible consumption and production pattern (SDG 12) and the overall goal of minimizing waste and resource depletion (SDG 11, 13, and 15). The study explores the flows of critical metals, such as indium, neodymium, and gold, associated with electronic equipment in Switzerland. The authors use dynamic material flow analysis to track the metals from their entry into Switzerland until their recovery, disposal, or dissipation. Through this analysis, they highlight the current waste streams generated by digital information and communications technologies (ICT) and the need for more effective recovery methods for critical metals beyond precious metals.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
The abstract discusses the flows of three critical metals associated with electronic equipment in Switzerland, highlighting the need for more effective recovery methods. The authors' findings demonstrate that the current collection and recycling system successfully concentrates these metals, with 70% of gold being recovered. This suggests that there is a need for improved recycling infrastructure and policies to recover indium and neodymium, which are currently being dissipated due to a lack of economic incentives and commercial-scale recovery processes. By promoting circular economy principles, such as designing for recyclability and reducing waste, we can reduce the use of virgin resources and minimize the environmental impact associated with extracting and processing these critical metals.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The study reveals that the second-largest stocks of indium are found in slags disposed in landfills. While this does not directly relate to SDG 15, it highlights the need for more sustainable disposal practices to minimize the environmental impact associated with the accumulation of these slags. By exploring innovative approaches to repurpose these slags, such as using them as building materials, we can reduce the demand for virgin resources and minimize the negative impact on land resources.

First, the Commission's capacity constraints and lack of specific expertise have prevented it from becoming an important host of trust funds like other international development organizations. Second, the same capacity constraints can generally explain its extensive participation in trust funds at other international development organizations. In the case of large global funds, however, Commission participation often reflects the outcome of member state politics.

The abstract presents a study on multi-bI aid in the European Union (EU). The analysis is based on new aid data and interviews with staff from the European Commission, the World Bank, and bilateral donors. The study draws three main conclusions. First, the EU Commission's capacity constraints and lack of specific expertise have hindered it from becoming a significant host of trust funds like other international development organizations. Second, these capacity constraints explain the Commission's widespread participation in trust funds at other organizations, except in the case of large global funds, where member state politics often determine participation. Third, after delegating aid to multilateral agencies, the Commission imposes strong legal and administrative controls, but does not impose significant substantive earmarking.","
Based on the provided abstract and core themes, it is unclear how this study relates to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To identify relevant SDG content, it is necessary to analyze the study's implications for the following SDGs: SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), SDG 15 (Life on Land), SDG 16 (Peace and Justice Strong Institutions), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

Upon analysis, the study does not explicitly discuss any of the SDGs. However, some implications for the SDGs can be drawn from the study's findings. Firstly, the study highlights the capacity constraints and lack of specific expertise of the EU Commission, which could impede the achievement of some SDGs related to development assistance. For instance, the Commission's limited capacity could hamper its ability to effectively implement trust funds for poverty eradication (SDG 1), hunger eradication (SDG 2), and access to education (SDG 4) in developing countries. Secondly, the study shows that member state politics can determine the EU Commission's participation in trust funds, which could affect the alignment of development assistance with the SDGs. For example, if member states prioritize their own national interests over the SDGs, it could result in insufficient resources being allocated to SDG-related trust funds. Thirdly, the study notes that after delegating aid to multilateral agencies, the EU Commission imposes strong legal and administrative controls. While this could potentially ensure the effective and transparent use of resources for SDG implementation, it is unclear whether these controls align with SDG-","
SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
The study highlights the role of capacity constraints and member state politics in determining the Commission's participation in multi-bI trust funds. This implies that the distribution of aid and the selection of trust funds to participate in are influenced by capacity constraints and political considerations, potentially leading to inequalities in aid allocation. Therefore, while this study does not directly address SDG 10, it raises questions about the fairness and transparency of the Commission's multi-bI aid decisions.

Warming and nutrient enrichment are major environmental factors shaping ecological dynamics. However, cross‐scale investigation of their combined effects by linking theory and experiments is lacking. We collected data from aquatic microbial ecosystems investigating the interactive effects of warming (constant and rising temperatures) and enrichment across levels of organisation and contrasted them with community models based on metabolic theory. We found high agreement between our observations and theoretical predictions: we observed in many cases the predicted antagonistic effects of high temperature and high enrichment across levels of organisation. Temporal stability of total biomass decreased with warming but did not differ across enrichment levels. Constant and rising temperature treatments with identical mean temperature did not show qualitative differences. Overall, we conclude that model and empirical results are in broad agreement due to robustness of the effects of temperature and enrichment, that the mitigating effects of temperature on effects of enrichment may be common, and that models based on metabolic theory provide qualitatively robust predictions of the combined ecological effects of enrichment and temperature.",14,"

Understanding the drivers of ecosystem change and their effects on ecosystem services are essential for management decisions and verification of progress towards national and international sustainability policies (e.g. Aichi Biodiversity Targets, Sustainable Development Goals). We aim to disentangle spatially the effect of climatological and non‐climatological drivers on ecosystem service supply and trends. Therefore, we explored time series of three ecosystem services in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014: carbon dioxide regulation, soil erosion prevention, and air quality regulation. We applied additive models to describe the spatial variation attributed to climatological (i.e. temperature, precipitation and relative sunshine duration) and non‐climatological drivers (i.e. random effects representing other spatially structured processes) that may affect ecosystem service change.
Obtained results indicated strong influences of climatological drivers on ecosystem service trends in Switzerland. We identified equal contributions of all three climatological drivers on trends of carbon dioxide regulation and soil erosion prevention, while air quality regulation was more strongly influenced by temperature. Additionally, our results showed that climatological and non‐climatological drivers affected ecosystem services both negatively and positively, depending on the regions (in particular lower and higher altitudinal areas), drivers, and services assessed.
Our findings highlight stronger effects of climatological compared to non‐climatological drivers on ecosystem service change in Switzerland. Furthermore, drivers of ecosystem change display a spatial heterogeneity in their influence on ecosystem service trends. We propose an approach building on an additive model to disentangle the effect of climatological and non‐climatological drivers on ecosystem service trends.

Under conditions of growing interconnectedness of the global economy, more and more stakeholders are exposed to risks and costs resulting from business activities that are neither regulated nor compensated for by means of national governance. The changing distribution of risks poses a threat to the legitimacy of business firms that normally derive their legitimacy from operating in compliance with the legal rules of democratic nation states. However, during the process of globalization, the regulatory power of nation states has been weakened and many production processes have been shifted to states with weak regulatory frameworks where businesses operate outside the reach of the democratic nation state. As a result, business firms have to address the various legitimacy challenges of their operations directly and cannot rely upon the legitimacy of their regulatory environment. These developments challenge the dominant approach to corporate governance that regards shareholders as the only stakeholder group in need of special protection due to risks not covered by contracts and legal regulations. On the basis of these considerations, we argue for a democratization of corporate governance structures in order to compensate for the governance deficits in their regulatory environment and to cope with the changing allocation of risks and costs. By way of democratic involvement of various stakeholders, business firms may be able to mitigate the redistribution of individual risk and address the resulting legitimacy deficits even when operating under conditions of regulatory gaps and governance failure.",12,"

153,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167418,"Ecological succession drives the structural change of seed-rodent interaction networks in fragmented forests
While deforestation and fragmentation can cause massive species loss in forest ecosystems, forest regeneration can also drive successional changes in species composition. Although studies have sometimes documented the effects of these compositional changes on interspecific interactions, few studies have investigated changes in the structure of plant-animal networks. We investigated how interaction networks of assemblages of rodents and tree seeds changed with forest fragmentation and succession in a subtropical region. We compared seed-rodent interactions between 14 secondary forest patches that ranged in area from 2 to 58 ha, and from 10 to at least 100 years old, representing a successional gradient. We expected that deforestation and fragmentation would reduce seed production and diversify rodent communities, resulting in higher interaction strengths and connectivity, but weak nestedness (i.e., specialists interact with subsets of the species interaction of generalists). We measured the frequency of rodents eating and removing seeds (interaction strength) in each patch during 3 successive years, using seed tagging and infrared camera trapping, and calculated the properties of the seed-rodent networks. We found that the relative abundances of seeds and rodents changed with stand age not patch size, as did seed-rodent interactions: older patches produced more seeds, contained fewer individuals and species of rodents, and had seed-rodent networks with lower connectance and interaction strength, but higher nestedness. Connectance and interaction strength decreased with metabolic per capita seed availability (as measured by seed energy value); nestedness increased with seed richness, but decreased with rodent abundance. At species level, we found stand age and patch size showed significant effects on seed or rodent abundance of a few species. We also found seed coat thickness and starch contents had significant effects on network metrics. Our results suggest that during succession after deforestation, seed-rodent interactions in these sub-tropical forests change from a state dominated by high seed removal and highly connected seed-rodent networks to a state with more seeds and highly nested networks. From a management perspective of our study region, succession age, not fragment size, and network structure should be paid more attention so as to facilitate the restoration processes of degraded forests. Rodent management should be applied to protect native forest species and exclude incursive ones from farmlands and human residences at early succession stage.",15,"
The abstract presents a study investigating how seed-rodent interaction networks change with forest fragmentation and succession in a subtropical region. The study compares seed-rodent interactions between 14 secondary forest patches with different sizes and ages, ranging from 2 to 58 ha and 10 to over 100 years old, respectively. The research aims to understand how compositional changes in forest regeneration affect interspecific interactions and the structure of plant-animal networks. The study hypothesizes that deforestation and fragmentation will lead to a reduction in seed production, diversification of rodent communities, higher interaction strengths, and weak nestedness.

This paper provides new evidence on gender bias in teaching evaluations. We exploit a quasi-experimental dataset of 19,952 student evaluations of university faculty in a context where students are randomly allocated to female or male instructors. Despite the fact that neither students’ grades nor self-study hours are affected by the instructor’s gender, we find that women receive systematically lower teaching evaluations than their male colleagues. This bias is driven by male students’ evaluations, is larger for mathematical courses, and particularly pronounced for junior women. The gender bias in teaching evaluations we document may have direct as well as indirect effects on the career progression of women by affecting junior women’s confidence and through the reallocation of instructor resources away from research and toward teaching.",5,"

We extract an exogenous measure of gender bias from survey responses by descendants of U.S. immigrants on questions about the role of women in society. We then use data on around 6,000 small business firms from 17 countries and find that in high-gender-bias countries, female entrepreneurs are more likely to opt out of the loan application process and to resort to informal finance, even though banks do not appear to actively discriminate against them. These results are not driven by credit risk differences between female- and male-owned firms or by any idiosyncrasies in the set of countries in our sample.",5,"

To respect the autonomous choices of persons is an important moral principle. There is, however, little agreement about its nature and its normative importance. This is due to the fact that the concept of autonomy as well as the moral relevance of autonomy are contested. It is argued in this paper that the debate about autonomy is at its core a debate about the reasons for respecting decisions. Decisions of persons are to be respected as their decisions, and they have to be respected as determining the deontic properties of situations. This, however, can only be understood against the background of persons having rights over themselves. Their decisions determine the deontic properties as exercises of their rights. Thus, respect for the autonomous choice of persons turns out to be respect for their rights.",10,"

This paper studies the impact of a key feature of competitive markets on moral behavior: the possibility that a competitor will step in and conclude the deal if a conscientious market actor forgoes a profitable business opportunity for ethical reasons. We study experimentally whether people employ the argument ""if I don’t do it, someone else will"" to justify taking a narrowly self-interested action. Our data reveal a clear pattern. Subjects do not employ the ""replacement excuse"" if a social norm exists that classifies the selfish action as immoral. But if no social norm exists, subjects are more inclined to take a selfish action in situations where another subject can otherwise take it. By demonstrating the importance of social norms of moral behavior for limiting the power of the replacement excuse, our paper informs the long-standing debate on the effect of markets on morals.",12,"
Core themes: The study explores the impact of competitive markets on moral behavior, specifically examining the role of social norms and the ""replacement excuse.""

In the spring of 2015, a series of shanshui landscapes by cartoon artist Feng Zikai decorated official China Dream posters in Shanghai, and could since then be encountered in the streets and subway stations of all major cities. While the dissem- ination of national values and active citizen participation in the government’s envi- ronmental modernization program is clearly the major trajectory, this rapprochement towards a formerly prosecuted artist concomitantly illustrates the current reorientation towards local traditions and cultural continuity in China’s state ideology and propa- ganda work. At the same time, the 2014/15 Shanghai arts scene contributed a number of avant-garde landscape art works that pronounced their creators’ concern about the environmental crisis. It will be argued that there is a subliminal dialogue between Xi Jinping’sproject of landscaping the China Dream and the artists’ selective reclamation of shanshui aesthetics in their ecocritical approaches.

161,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:158678,"Values, attitudes toward interpersonal violence, and interpersonal violent behavior
The relevance of human values for the study of the motivational sources of interpersonal violent behavior was investigated in various fields of the social sciences. However, several past studies mixed up values with other dimensions like attitudes, norms, or beliefs, and only a few systematically assessed the effect of values on violent behavior relying on a value theory. Furthermore, in other studies, violence was often analyzed as a composite index of different forms of delinquent behavior rather than as violence per se. In the current study we address these gaps in the literature by building upon Schwartz’ theory of basic human values. We use it to explain attitudes toward interpersonal violence and interpersonal violent behavior. We analyze data of young people (n = 1,810) drawn from a German study in Duisburg, Germany, which assessed various types of self-reported violent behavior as well as values and attitudes toward violence. We test structural equation models in which we explain interpersonal violent behavior with basic human values, and where attitudes toward interpersonal violent behavior mediate this relation. Results show that self-transcendence and conservation values are associated negatively and power and stimulation values positively with interpersonal violent behavior. In addition, attitudes operate as a partial mediator for the former and as a full mediator for the latter in the relation between values and violent behavior. Despite a dominant association between attitudes and behavior, values themselves can significantly contribute to the explanation of violent behavior.",16,"
In this abstract, the study investigates the relationship between human values, attitudes towards interpersonal violence, and interpersonal violent behavior. It critiques past research for conflating values with other dimensions and analyzing violence as a composite index. The study uses Schwartz' theory of basic human values to explain attitudes towards violence and interpersonal violent behavior, specifically self-transcendence, conservation, power, and stimulation values. The authors analyze data from a German study and find that self-transcendence and conservation values are negatively associated with interpersonal violent behavior, while power and stimulation values are positively associated. Attitudes towards interpersonal violent behavior mediate the relationship between values and behavior, with attitudes operating as a partial mediator for self-transcendence and conservation values and a full mediator for power and stimulation values. While attitudes are a dominant predictor of behavior, values themselves contribute significantly to the explanation of violent behavior. Overall, the study highlights the importance of distinguishing between values and other dimensions and utilizing a value theory to understand the motivational sources of interpersonal violent behavior.","
While this abstract does not directly address any of the Sustainable Development Goals, it does touch upon issues related to SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions. Specifically, the study's focus on understanding the motivational sources of interpersonal violent behavior can provide insights into how values and attitudes contribute to violent behavior, which can inform efforts to promote peace and justice. For example, by identifying which values are associated with interpersonal violent behavior, interventions can be developed to promote alternative values that align with the goals of peace and justice. Additionally, by understanding the relationship between attitudes and behavior, targeted interventions can be developed to address negative attitudes towards violence and promote more positive attitudes towards peaceful alternatives. While this study does not explicitly address the SDGs, it highlights the importance of understanding the motivational sources of violent behavior, which is relevant to efforts to promote peace and justice, particularly as outlined in SDG 16.","
SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
The study's results suggest that individuals who prioritize conservation and self-transcendence values are less likely to engage in interpersonal violent behavior, which could potentially contribute to reducing inequalities in society. These values prioritize environmental and social concerns, suggesting that individuals with these values may be less likely to resort to violence in the pursuit of resources or as a means of gaining power over others. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, as individuals with these values may be less inclined to engage in violent behavior that could disrupt social norms and contribute to inequality.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
The study's findings highlight the importance of attitudes towards interpersonal violence in preventing violent behavior, which is crucial for promoting peace and preventing injustice. The study suggests that attitudes towards violence serve as a mediator between values and violent behavior, indicating that changing attitudes towards violence could help prevent violent behavior and promote peaceful and just societies. Strong institutions, such as schools and communities, could play a role in promoting positive attitudes towards violence and preventing violent behavior, thus contributing to the achievement of SDG 16.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The study's focus on conservation values could also contribute to achieving SDG 15, which is focused on protecting the environment and promoting sustainable land use. Conservation values prioritize environmental concerns, suggesting that individuals with these values may be less likely to engage in violent behavior that could contribute to environmental degradation or the exploitation of natural resources. This could lead to more sustainable land use practices and a reduction in conflicts related to environmental resources, thereby contributing to SDG 15.

Overall, the study's results suggest that values and attitudes towards interpersonal violence could contribute to achieving several SDGs, particularly SDGs 10, 16, and 15, which are focused on reducing inequalities, promoting peace and justice, and protecting the environment, respectively.","
The study explores the relationship between human values, attitudes towards interpersonal violence, and interpersonal violent behavior. Past research has conflated values with other dimensions and analyzed violence as a composite index, leading to gaps in the literature. This study utilizes Schwartz' theory of basic human values to explain attitudes towards violence and interpersonal violent behavior. The study finds that self-transcendence and conservation values are negatively associated with interpersonal violent behavior, while power and stimulation values are positively associated. Attitudes towards interpersonal violent behavior mediate the relationship between values and behavior, with attitudes operating as a partial mediator for self-transcendence and conservation values and a full mediator for power and stimulation values. While attitudes are a dominant predictor of behavior, values themselves contribute significantly to the explanation of violent behavior. These findings suggest that promoting conservation and self-transcendence values could contribute to reducing inequalities (SDG 10), promoting peace and preventing injustice (SDG 16), and protecting the environment (SDG 15). The study highlights the importance of understanding the motivational sources of violent behavior in promoting these goals.","
Based on the insights and the analysis provided in the abstract, the study's contributions towards the SDGs are:

SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities: The study found that conservation and self-transcendence values, which are associated negatively with interpersonal violent behavior, could contribute to reducing inequalities by promoting values that prioritize social cohesion, environmental protection, and a long-term perspective over immediate self-interest.

SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The study highlights the importance of understanding the motivational sources of violent behavior in promoting peace and preventing injustice. By examining the relationship between human values, attitudes towards violence, and interpersonal violent behavior, the study contributes to building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels, as well as promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development.

SDG 15 - Life on Land: The study suggests that promoting conservation and self-transcendence values could contribute to protecting the environment by reducing interpersonal violent behavior, which can result in environmental damage and degradation.

It is essential to note that while attitudes are a dominant predictor of behavior, values themselves contribute significantly to the explanation of violent behavior. Therefore, promoting conservation and self-transcendence values, as well as addressing power and stimulation values, could contribute to reducing interpersonal violent behavior and promoting peace, justice, and environmental protection.

Based on the contribution of the study towards the SDGs, we rank the SDGs as follows:

SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions (Rank 1)
SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities (Rank 2)
SDG 15 - Life on Land (Rank 3)

No contribution was identified towards SDG 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 13, and hence, they are not ranked.

There is a growing body of research showing that people altruistically enforce cooperation norms in social dilemmas. Most of this research analyzes situations where norm violators are known and group members enforce cooperation among each other. However, in many situations norm violators are unknown and detection and punishment is enforced by third parties, such as in plagiarism, tax evasion, doping or even two-timing. Our contribution is threefold. Conceptually, we show the usefulness of inspection game experiments for studying normative behavior in these situations. Methodologically, we present a novel measurement of strategic norm adherence and enforcement, asking for continuous, ""frequentistic"" choice probabilities. Substantively, we demonstrate that norm adherence in these situations is best understood by coexisting distinct actor types. Self-regarding types learn the inspection rate and calibrate their norm violations to maximize own payoffs. Other-regarding types reciprocate experienced victimizations by stealing from other, unknown group members; even at additional costs. We specify both mechanisms by agent-based simulation models and compare their relative strength by behavioral and attitudinal data in inspection game experiments (N=220). Our results suggest a modern sociological perspective, which combines homo oeconomicus with homo sociologicus. Further, our findings contribute to understanding conditional norm compliance in ""broken windows"" dynamics, since we show under controlled conditions that it may result jointly from self- and other regarding mechanisms.",16,"

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

The abstract's relevance to SDG 12 is limited, as the research does not directly address responsible consumption and production. However, the abstract mentions the concept of ""broken windows"" dynamics, which refers to the idea that small signs of disorder, such as broken windows, can lead to further crime and disorder in a neighborhood. This concept has been applied to social norms, where small violations can lead to further violations and undermine social order. By understanding the mechanisms for adherence to social norms, particularly in situations where norm violators are unknown, this research can contribute to preventing small violations from escalating into larger problems, which is relevant to SDG 12's goal of ensuring that products and services are designed to be sustainable throughout their life cycle.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions

The abstract's relevance to SDG 16 is more apparent, as the research explores mechanisms for adherence to social norms in situations where norm violators are unknown and detection and punishment is enforced by third parties. This research can contribute to understanding how social norms can promote peace and justice in societies, particularly in situations where norm violators may go unpunished due to lack of evidence or resources. By identifying self- and other-regarding mechanisms for norm adherence, this research can also inform the design of institutions and policies that promote social norms and prevent social disorder.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

The abstract's relevance to SDG 17 is indirect, as the authors highlight the importance of interdisciplinary research that combines elements of homo oeconomicus and homo sociologicus. This research can contribute to partnerships between economists and sociologists, as well as other disciplines, to promote a better understanding of social norms and their impact on behavior and social order.

The role of development finance institutions in low‐income and emerging countries is fundamental to provide long‐term capital for investments in climate mitigation and adaptation. Nevertheless, development finance institutions still lack sound and transparent metrics to assess their projects' exposure to climate risks and their impact on global climate action. To attempt to fill this gap, we develop a novel climate stress‐test methodology for portfolios of loans to energy infrastructure projects. We apply the methodology to the portfolios of overseas energy projects of two main Chinese policy banks. We estimate their exposure to economic and financial shocks that would result in government inability to introduce timely 2°C‐aligned climate policies and from investors' inability to adapt their business to the changing climate and policy environment. We find that the negative shocks are mostly concentrated on coal and oil projects and vary across regions from 4.2 to 22 percent of the total loan value.

Forest cover in Switzerland and other European countries has gradually increased in the past century. Our knowledge of the impacts of forest expansion and development on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is, however, limited due to uncertainties in land-use history and lack of historical soil samples. We investigated the effect of forest age on current SOC storage in Switzerland. For 857 sites, we analysed SOC stocks and determined the minimal forest age for all presently forested sites using digitized historical maps, classifying all sites into three categories: young (≤60 years), medium (60–120 years), and old (≥120 years) forests. Grassland was the primary previous use of afforested land. Forest age affected current SOC stocks only moderately, whereas climate, soil chemistry, and tree species exerted a stronger impact. In the organic layer, highest SOC stocks were found in medium sites ($3.0 \pm 0.3 kg C m^{−2}$). As compared to other age categories, these sites had a 10% higher cover in coniferous forests with higher organic layer C stocks than broadleaf forests. SOC stocks in mineral soils decreased with increasing forest age ($12.5 \pm 0.9, 11.4 \pm 0.5, 10.5 \pm 0.3 kg C m^{−2}$). This decrease was primarily related to a 200-m higher average elevation of young sites and higher SOC stocks in a colder and more humid climate. In summary, forest age has only a minor effect on SOC storage in Swiss forest soils. Therefore, ongoing forest expansion in mountainous regions of Europe is unlikely contributing to soil C sequestration.",13,"

The provided abstract focuses on the impacts of forest expansion and development on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in Switzerland. The study's core themes reveal insights that potentially impact the following SDGs:

SDG 13 - Climate Action: The study highlights that ongoing forest expansion in mountainous regions of Europe is not significantly contributing to soil C sequestration. This finding could potentially impact SDG 13, which aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, as forests are known to be important carbon sinks that help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. While forest expansion in Switzerland is not significantly contributing to soil C sequestration, other factors such as climate and soil chemistry play a stronger role in SOC storage. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors when developing climate action strategies related to forest management.

SDG 15 - Life on Land: The study also sheds light on the impacts of forest expansion on SOC storage in Swiss forest soils. The study reveals that grassland was the primary previous use of afforested land, indicating that forest expansion could potentially lead to a loss of grassland habitats, which could impact SDG 15's goal to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the study also suggests that medium-aged forests have higher SOC stocks than young and old forests, which could potentially contribute to SDG 15's goal of combating desertification and halting biodiversity loss by maintaining healthy forest ecosystems.

Overall, the study's insights could potentially impact SDG 13 and SDG 15, highlighting the importance of considering the complex interplay between forest expansion, climate, soil chemistry, and forest age when developing strategies related to these SDGs.","
SDG 13: Climate Action
This abstract contributes to SDG 13 as it explores the impacts of forest expansion and development on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in Switzerland. The study reveals that forest age has only a minor effect on SOC stocks, with highest SOC stocks found in medium forests (3.0 ± 0.3 kg C m^-2) compared to young (≤60 years) and old (≥120 years) forests. This finding is significant for climate action as SOC can act as a carbon sink, reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and mitigating climate change. The study also highlights that climate, soil chemistry, and tree species have a stronger impact on current SOC stocks than forest age, which could inform forest management practices and carbon sequestration strategies.

SDG 15: Life on Land
This abstract contributes to SDG 15 as it explores the impacts of forest expansion and development on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in Switzerland, which is a critical component of terrestrial ecosystems. The study reveals that grassland was the primary previous use of afforested land, and that forest age has only a minor effect on SOC stocks. This finding could inform land use decisions and forest management practices, as forest expansion on previously grassland-covered areas could have limited impacts on SOC storage. The study also highlights that climate, soil chemistry, and tree species have a stronger impact on current SOC stocks than forest age, which could inform forest management practices and carbon sequestration strategies.

The study presented in the abstract contributes to SDGs 13 and 15 related to climate action and sustainable land use practices. The research examines the effects of forest expansion and development on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in Switzerland, shedding light on the interplay between forest age, climate, soil chemistry, and tree species. The study reveals that forest age has a minor effect on SOC stocks, with highest SOC stocks found in medium-aged forests (3.0 ± 0.3 kg C m^-2). Grassland was the primary previous use of afforested land, indicating that forest expansion could potentially lead to a loss of grassland habitats. However, medium-aged forests have higher SOC stocks than young and old forests, which could contribute to combating desertification and halting biodiversity loss by maintaining healthy forest ecosystems. Climate and soil chemistry play a stronger role in SOC storage than forest age. These findings could inform land use decisions, forest management practices, and carbon sequestration strategies, as they could potentially impact SDGs 13 and 15. The study's insights highlight the need to consider the complex interplay between forest expansion, climate, soil chemistry, and forest age when developing strategies related to these SDGs.","

We present a model of deliberative inclusion, focusing on reciprocity in the interaction between structural minorities/disadvantaged groups and majorities/privileged groups. Our model, however, comes with a ‘friendly amendment’: we have put the ‘burden of reciprocity’ mainly on majorities and privileged groups. It is mainly their obligation to seriously listen and respond to the demands and arguments of minorities and disadvantaged groups and show a willingness to respect and accommodate these interests. Empirically, we apply our model to the interaction of linguistic groups in the Swiss parliament. We find a highly egalitarian, sometimes even minority-favoring mode of interaction between the German-speaking majority and linguistic minorities. The German-speaking majority seems to be willing to take the ‘burden of reciprocity’ when linguistic minorities’ vital interests are concerned. Conversely, linguistic minorities are slightly more self-referential and adversarial under such conditions.",10,"

When popular referendums fail to ratify new international agreements or succeed in reversing existing ones, it not only affects domestic voters but also creates negative spillovers for the other parties to such agreements. We explore how voters respond to this strategic environment. We use original survey data from a poll fielded just one day before the 2015 Greek bailout referendum—a referendum in which the stakes for other countries were particularly high—to investigate how expectations about the likely foreign response to a noncooperative referendum outcome influence voting behavior and to what extent foreign policymakers can influence those expectations. Our analysis of the Greek referendum shows that such expectations had a powerful effect on voting behavior: voters expecting that a noncooperative referendum outcome would force Greece to leave the eurozone were substantially more likely to vote cooperatively than those believing that it would result in renewed negotiations with the country's creditors. Leveraging the bank closure that took place right before the vote, we also show that costly signals by foreign actors made voters more pessimistic about the consequences of a noncooperative vote and substantially increased the share of cooperative votes.",17,"

Reducing tax evasion is a priority for many governments. A growing literature argues that verifying taxpayer reports against third-party information is critical for tax collection. However, effectiveness can be limited when tax authorities face constraints to credible enforcement and taxpayers make offsetting adjustments on other margins. We exploit a policy intervention in which Ecuadorian firms were notified about detected revenue discrepancies. Most firms simply failed to respond. Firms that responded increased reported revenue, matching the discrepancy amount when provided. However, they also increased reported costs by 96 cents per dollar of revenue adjustment, resulting in minor increases in tax collection.",12,"
The abstract, ""Dodging the taxman: firm misreporting and limits to tax enforcement,"" explores the issue of tax evasion and its impact on government revenue collection. The study argues that verifying taxpayer reports against third-party information is essential for effective tax enforcement, but this approach may be limited by constraints on credible enforcement and taxpayers making offsetting adjustments on other margins. The authors examine a policy intervention in Ecuador where firms were notified of detected revenue discrepancies. The majority of firms failed to respond, but those that did increased reported revenue to match the discrepancy amount provided. However, they also increased reported costs by 96 cents per dollar of revenue adjustment, resulting in minor increases in tax collection. This highlights the limits to tax enforcement due to taxpayers making offsetting adjustments on other margins. Overall, the study sheds light on the challenges faced by tax authorities in reducing tax evasion and the need for more credible enforcement measures.","
This abstract primarily relates to SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions, specifically the theme of effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. While it does not explicitly address the other SDGs, the issue of tax evasion and its impact on government revenue collection is crucial for achieving several SDGs.

Reducing tax evasion is essential for achieving SDG 1 - No Poverty, as tax revenue can be used to fund social programs and infrastructure projects that alleviate poverty. Additionally, tax revenue is crucial for achieving SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being, as it can be used to fund healthcare initiatives and improve public health systems.

The study's findings also highlight the importance of credible enforcement measures for achieving SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals, as effective tax enforcement is critical for promoting accountability and reducing corruption. By limiting tax evasion, governments can ensure that resources are used efficiently and effectively to achieve the SDGs.

Furthermore, the study sheds light on the need for more inclusive institutions, as the majority of firms in the study failed to respond to the policy intervention. This highlights the importance of ensuring that all taxpayers, regardless of size or location, are subject to credible enforcement measures.

In summary, while the abstract does not explicitly address all 17 SDGs, its focus on tax evasion and its impact on government revenue collection is critical for achieving several SDGs, particularly SDG 1, SDG 3, and SDG 17. It underscores the need for effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions, including credible enforcement measures, to promote sustainable development.","
SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
The study's findings shed light on the unequal distribution of tax liabilities due to tax evasion. By increasing reported costs, firms may be able to offset the increased tax liability from revenue adjustments, thereby reducing the overall tax burden. This highlights the need for more effective tax enforcement measures to level the playing field and ensure that all individuals and companies pay their fair share of taxes.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
The study's results suggest that firms may be adjusting their production costs to offset revenue adjustments, which could potentially lead to increased production costs and higher prices for consumers. This could contribute to unsustainable consumption patterns and further exacerbate economic inequality. Therefore, more responsible production practices and measures to address tax evasion could contribute to more sustainable consumption and production patterns in the long run.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
The study highlights the need for stronger institutions and effective tax enforcement measures to combat tax evasion. The authors note that many firms failed to respond to the policy intervention, indicating a lack of accountability and compliance with tax laws. More effective enforcement mechanisms and legal frameworks are necessary to ensure that all individuals and companies are subject to the same tax obligations, promoting transparency, accountability, and justice.

SDG 15: Life on Land
While the study does not directly address SDG 15, the potential impact of tax evasion on land use and environmental policies should not be overlooked. Tax evasion in the agriculture or forestry sectors could potentially result in the underreporting of land use activities or resource extraction, leading to unsustainable land use practices and environmental degradation. More effective tax enforcement measures in these sectors could promote more sustainable land use patterns and contribute to the conservation of natural resources.

In conclusion, the study's findings have implications for all four SDGs mentioned above, highlighting the need for more effective tax enforcement measures, responsible production practices, and strong institutions to combat tax evasion and promote sustainable and equitable economic development.","
The study ""Dodging the taxman: firm misreporting and limits to tax enforcement"" explores the issue of tax evasion and its impact on government revenue collection. While it does not explicitly address all 17 SDGs, its findings shed light on the unequal distribution of tax liabilities due to tax evasion (SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities), potentially contributing to unsustainable consumption patterns and further exacerbating economic inequality (SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production). The study highlights the need for stronger institutions and effective tax enforcement measures to combat tax evasion (SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) and potentially promote more sustainable land use patterns and contribute to the conservation of natural resources (SDG 15: Life on Land). Overall, the study underscores the importance of effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions, including credible enforcement measures, to promote sustainable development and reduce tax evasion.","
Based on the insights, we can rank the SDGs the abstract contributes to in the following order, with the magnitude of contribution decreasing:

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities - The study highlights the unequal distribution of tax liabilities due to tax evasion, which potentially contributes to economic inequality.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions - The study emphasizes the need for stronger institutions and effective tax enforcement measures to combat tax evasion.

SDG 15: Life on Land - The study suggests that tax evasion could potentially lead to unsustainable land use patterns and further exacerbate the depletion of natural resources, as firms may use undeclared revenues to expand operations at the expense of the environment.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production - The study indicates that tax evasion could potentially contribute to unsustainable consumption patterns, as firms may use undeclared revenues to engage in excessive consumption and production activities.

No other SDG is directly contributed to by the study's findings. However, it is worth mentioning that effective tax enforcement measures could potentially lead to increased tax revenue, which could contribute to SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, as well as SDG 1: No Poverty and SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, as governments could allocate more resources towards these goals.

It is crucial to note that the study's findings are specific to Ecuador and may not be generalizable to other contexts. Nevertheless, its insights shed light on the importance of effective tax enforcement measures to combat tax evasion and promote sustainable development, highlighting the interconnectedness of various SDGs.","

The standard model explains a relatively small portion of the joint decline in routine employment and the associated rise in non-routine manual employment and non-employment.","
The provided abstract and core themes do not directly relate to any specific SDG. However, some indirect implications impacting SDGs can be identified:

1. SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
The decline in employment in middle-wage, routine occupations could lead to job displacement and income inequality, potentially impacting SDG 8. The authors' findings suggest that the rise in non-employment and employment in low-wage, non-routine manual occupations could result in a shift towards lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs, which could exacerbate income inequality. Policies that aim to mitigate the negative impacts of automation on employment and promote job creation in high-skilled, high-wage occupations could help achieve SDG 8.

2. SDG 1: No Poverty
As mentioned in the abstract, the increase in non-employment could contribute to poverty, particularly for specific demographic groups. Policies that aim to address poverty and promote social inclusion, such as social welfare programs and education initiatives, could help mitigate the negative impacts of job displacement and promote sustainable development in line with SDG 1.

3. SDG 4: Quality Education
The authors' findings suggest that the rise in non-employment could lead to skills mismatches and a lack of job opportunities for individuals with middle-wage, routine occupational skills. Policies that aim to promote lifelong learning and provide opportunities for individuals to acquire new skills could help individuals adapt to changes in the labor market and achieve SDG 4.

4. SDG 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions
The authors' analysis highlights the importance of endogenous participation and occupation choice in response to changes in the labor market. Policies that aim to promote social mobility and equal opportunities for all, particularly for specific demographic groups, could help achieve SDG 16.

Overall, the abstract and core themes suggest that the rise of automation and changes in the labor market could have far-reaching impacts on employment, income inequality, and social inclusion. Policies that aim to address these challenges and promote sustainable development in line with the SDGs could help mitigate the negative impacts of automation on employment and promote social inclusion.","
SDG 5: Gender Equality

The abstract does not directly address SDG 5, as there is no explicit mention of gender equality or any analysis of the impact of automation technology on women's employment in routine jobs. However, the authors do note that the decline in routine employment is primarily driven by changes in the propensity to work in routine jobs for specific demographic groups. As women have traditionally been overrepresented in certain routine occupations, such as administrative support, this suggests that women may be disproportionately affected by the decline in routine employment. It is therefore important to further investigate the impact of automation technology on women's employment in routine jobs to ensure that gender equality is not negatively impacted.

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

The abstract highlights the decline in employment in middle-wage, routine occupations in the US over the last 35 years, which has significant implications for SDG 8. The authors suggest that this decline is primarily driven by changes in the propensity to work in routine jobs for specific demographic groups, many of whom are now working in low-wage, non-routine manual occupations. This shift could potentially lead to lower wages and poorer working conditions, as non-routine manual occupations are often lower-skilled and less well-paid than routine occupations. Additionally, the rise in non-employment could further exacerbate income inequality and poverty, as individuals without employment may be more vulnerable to social and economic exclusion. The authors' analysis of a general neoclassical model of the labor market also highlights the tradeoff between reallocating employment across occupations and reallocating workers towards non-employment in response to an increase in automation technology, which could have significant implications for employment opportunities and wages in the future.

SDG 15: Life on Land

The abstract does not directly address SDG 15, as there is no explicit mention of sustainable land use or conservation efforts. However, the decline in employment in routine occupations could potentially have implications for land use and conservation efforts, as individuals who have lost employment in routine occupations may be more likely to engage in unsustainable land use practices or to migrate to urban areas in search of employment, putting further pressure on already strained urban infrastructure. Additionally, the rise in non-employment could potentially exacerbate poverty and","

The provided abstract focuses on the relationship between offshoring and individual party preferences in multiparty systems. While this does not explicitly relate to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are some implications impacting SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities.

The authors find that the effects of offshoring on party preferences vary by skill level and exposure, with low-skilled individuals exposed to offshoring being more likely to prefer leftist political parties that prioritize social protection and redistribution. This suggests that offshoring may exacerbate income and wealth inequalities, as low-skilled individuals may be disproportionately affected by job losses due to offshoring. This aligns with SDG 10, which aims to reduce inequality within and among countries.

Moreover, the authors argue that exposure to offshoring influences individual preferences for political parties with clear policy positions on issues relevant for individuals with offshorable jobs, specifically left, liberal, and center-right parties. This highlights the importance of political policies in addressing the social and economic consequences of offshoring, as individuals may seek out political parties that prioritize their interests in this context. This can potentially impact policy decisions related to offshoring and its impacts on income and wealth inequality.

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
The abstract suggests that the effects of offshoring on individual party preferences vary by skill level, with high-skilled individuals preferring liberal and center-right parties that promote economic openness, while low-skilled individuals prefer leftist parties that prioritize social protection and redistribution. This indicates that offshoring may contribute to income and wealth inequality, as individuals in high-skilled jobs may benefit from economic openness policies, while those in low-skilled jobs may feel the negative consequences of offshoring and prefer policies that mitigate its effects. Therefore, this research may be relevant to SDG 10, which aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
The abstract does not directly relate to SDG 12, which aims to ensure responsible consumption and production patterns. However, offshoring is a production strategy that can impact both consumption and production patterns, as it often leads to the relocation of industries to low-wage countries, resulting in changes in consumption patterns due to the availability and affordability of goods produced in offshore locations. Therefore, further research could investigate the relationship between offshoring and responsible consumption and production patterns to determine the impact of offshoring on sustainability and environmental concerns.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals
The abstract suggests that exposure to offshoring affects individual preferences for political parties with clear policy positions on issues relevant for individuals with offshorable jobs, but does not affect voting decisions for green and populist right parties. This implies that offshoring may influence political preferences and decision-making processes related to partnerships for the SDGs. Therefore, further research could investigate the relationship between offshoring and partnerships for the SDGs to understand how offshoring may impact policy decisions related to partnerships for sustainable development.

In summary, while not directly related to SDG 12, the abstract highlights the relevance of offshoring to SDG 10 and 17, indicating that further research could help to inform policy decisions related to these SDGs. However, it is essential to consider that the relevance of the SDGs to the research may depend on the specific context and research question, and further research may be required to confirm the relevance of the SDGs in each case.","

In the 1980s the Japanese “keiretsu” system of interconnected business groups was praised as a model to emulate, but since then Japan has often been criticized for being less innovative than the United States. In this paper we connect the two views and argue that tight business relationships can create dynamic inefficiencies and reduce broad innovations. In particular, we consider the repeated interaction between final good producers and intermediate input suppliers, where the provision of the intermediate input is noncontractible. We build a cooperative equilibrium where producers can switch suppliers and start cooperation immediately with new suppliers. We first consider broad innovations: every period, one supplier has the opportunity to create a higher quality input that can be used by all producers. Since relationships are harder to break in the cooperative equilibrium the market size for potential innovators is smaller and the rate of innovation might be lower than in the noncooperative equilibrium. We contrast this with a setting with relationship-specific innovations that we show are encouraged by the establishment of relational contracts. We illustrate the predictions of the model using the recent business history of the United States and Japan and further use patent data to show that U.S. patents are more general than Japanese and even more so in sectors using more differentiated inputs.

This abstract explores the relationship between long-term business relationships and innovation in the context of final good producers and intermediate input suppliers. The paper argues that while tight business relationships, such as those seen in the Japanese ""keiretsu"" system, can lead to static gains, they also create dynamic inefficiencies and reduce broad innovations. The authors consider scenarios where suppliers have the opportunity to create higher quality inputs, and find that the market size for potential innovators is smaller in the cooperative equilibrium, where relationships are harder to break. This may lead to a lower rate of innovation compared to the noncooperative equilibrium.

The provided abstract explores the impact of long-term business relationships, specifically in the context of final good producers and intermediate input suppliers, on innovation. This topic is relevant to SDG 9, which aims to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. 

The abstract highlights how tight business relationships, such as those seen in the Japanese ""keiretsu"" system, can lead to static gains, but also create dynamic inefficiencies and reduce broad innovations. Specifically, the authors argue that the market size for potential innovators is smaller in the cooperative equilibrium, where relationships are harder to break, compared to the noncooperative equilibrium. This could potentially lead to a lower rate of innovation, which could hinder progress towards SDG 4, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. However, the authors also contrast this with a setting where innovations are relationship-specific, which are encouraged by the establishment of relational contracts. This highlights the importance of considering the specific nature of innovations when evaluating the impact of business relationships on innovation.

The authors illustrate the predictions of the model using historical data, showing that U.S. patents are more general than Japanese, particularly in sectors with more differentiated inputs. This could be indicative of a more innovative culture in the United States, which could contribute to progress towards SDG 8, which aims to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
The paper's findings have implications for SDG 8, which aims to promote sustained economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. The authors argue that while tight business relationships can lead to static gains, they also create dynamic inefficiencies and potentially reduce broad innovations. This could, in turn, hinder economic growth and limit employment opportunities. The paper's illustration of the lower rate of innovation in Japan compared to the United States in sectors with more differentiated inputs suggests that countries should consider the potential impact of their business relationship structures on innovation and economic growth. Policymakers may want to consider the trade-off between short-term gains from tight relationships and long-term growth from fostering a dynamic and innovative business environment.

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
The paper's exploration of broad and relationship-specific innovations is closely related to SDG 9, which aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. The authors find that tight business relationships may hinder broad innovations, potentially slowing down the pace of industrialization. This could be a challenge for countries aiming to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, as broad innovations are often critical for driving productivity and competitiveness. The paper's illustration of the U.S.'s higher rate of general patents compared to Japan suggests that countries should consider the potential trade-offs between relationship-specific and broad innovations when designing policies to promote industrialization. Policymakers may want to consider the potential benefits of fostering a more diverse and innovative ecosystem, which could lead to a broader range of innovative inputs and products.

Semi-terrestrial soils such as floodplain soils are considered potential hot spots of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Microhabitats in the soil – such as within and outside of aggregates, in the detritusphere, and/or in the rhizosphere – are considered to promote and preserve specific redox conditions. Yet our understanding of the relative effects of such microhabitats and their interactions on N2O production and consumption in soils is still incomplete. Therefore, we assessed the effect of aggregate size, buried leaf litter, and plant–soil interactions on the occurrence of enhanced N2O emissions under simulated flooding/drying conditions in a mesocosm experiment. We used two model soils with equivalent structure and texture, comprising macroaggregates (4000–250 µm) or microaggregates (<250 µm) from a N-rich floodplain soil. These model soils were planted with basket willow (Salix viminalis L.), mixed with leaf litter or left unamended. After 48 h of flooding, a period of enhanced N2O emissions occurred in all treatments. The unamended model soils with macroaggregates emitted significantly more N2O during this period than those with microaggregates. Litter addition modulated the temporal pattern of the N2O emission, leading to short-term peaks of high N2O fluxes at the beginning of the period of enhanced N2O emission. The presence of S. viminalis strongly suppressed the N2O emission from the macroaggregate model soil, masking any aggregate-size effect. Integration of the flux data with data on soil bulk density, moisture, redox potential and soil solution composition suggest that macroaggregates provided more favourable conditions for spatially coupled nitrification–denitrification, which are particularly conducive to net N2O production. The local increase in organic carbon in the detritusphere appears to first stimulate N2O emissions; but ultimately, respiration of the surplus organic matter shifts the system towards redox conditions where N2O reduction to N2 dominates. Similarly, the low emission rates in the planted soils can be best explained by root exudation of low-molecular-weight organic substances supporting complete denitrification in the anoxic zones, but also by the inhibition of denitrification in the zone, where rhizosphere aeration takes place. Together, our experiments highlight the importance of microhabitat formation in regulating oxygen (O2) content and the completeness of denitrification in soils during drying after saturation. Moreover, they will help to better predict the conditions under which hot spots, and “hot moments”, of enhanced N2O emissions are most likely to occur in hydrologically dynamic soil systems like floodplain soils.",13,"
The abstract explores the impact of aggregate size, litter accumulation, and plant-soil interactions on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in floodplain soils during simulated flooding and drying conditions. The study aims to understand the effects of microhabitats such as within and outside of aggregates, in the detritusphere, and in the rhizosphere on N2O production and consumption in soils. The research reveals that unamended model soils with larger macroaggregates (4000-250um) emit significantly more N2O during a period of enhanced N2O emissions than those with smaller microaggregates (<250um). The addition of buried leaf litter alters the temporal pattern of N2O emissions, leading to short-term peaks at the beginning of the period of enhanced N2O emission. The presence of basket willow (Salix viminalis L.) strongly suppresses N2O emissions from macroaggregate model soils, masking any aggregate-size effect.

The provided abstract explores the impact of aggregate size, litter accumulation, and plant-soil interactions on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in floodplain soils during simulated flooding and drying conditions. This research contributes to several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically:

SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
Flooding and drying are natural hydrological processes in floodplain soils, and understanding how they impact N2O emissions is important for managing water resources sustainably. The study's findings can help predict when and where ""hot spots"" of enhanced N2O emissions are most likely to occur, which can inform water management strategies to minimize these emissions.

SDG 13: Climate Action
N2O is a potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential 298 times that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year time horizon. Reducing N2O emissions is therefore critical to mitigating climate change. The insights gained from this study can inform strategies to mitigate N2O emissions from floodplain soils, which can contribute to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

SDG 15: Life on Land
Floodplain soils are important ecosystems that support a diverse range of plant and animal species. Understanding how aggregate size, litter accumulation, and plant-soil interactions impact N2O emissions in these soils is therefore important for managing them sustainably. By reducing N2O emissions, we can help preserve the biodiversity and ecological integrity of these ecosystems.

In summary, this research contributes to the SDGs related to water resource management, climate action, and sustainable land use.","
SDG 13: Climate Action

The research presented in the abstract can contribute to SDG 13 by shedding light on the impact of floodplain soils on greenhouse gas emissions, specifically nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a potent greenhouse gas. The study reveals that aggregate size, litter accumulation, and plant-soil interactions play a significant role in regulating N2O emissions during flooding and drying conditions. This finding can inform strategies for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural and land-use practices in floodplain areas, which are becoming increasingly important as sea levels rise and extreme weather events become more frequent.

SDG 15: Life on Land

The study's focus on floodplain soils and the role of plant-soil interactions also relates to SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, and mountains. By understanding the factors that govern N2O emissions from floodplain soils, we can better manage these ecosystems to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and promote carbon sequestration. Additionally, the study's findings highlight the importance of microhabitats in these ecosystems, such as the detritusphere and the rhizosphere, and how they impact N2O emissions. This understanding can inform strategies for managing and conserving these ecosystems, such as the restoration of wetlands and the promotion of sustainable agriculture practices.

In conclusion, the research presented in the abstract is relevant to both SDG 13 and SDG 15 due to its focus on greenhouse gas emissions from floodplain soils and the importance of microhabitats in these ecosystems. By understanding the factors that govern N2O emissions from floodplain soils, we can better manage these ecosystems to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable land use practices.","

The introductory article to the special issue discusses how the extension of voting rights beyond citizenship (that is, to non-national immigrants) and residence (that is, to expatriates) can be interpreted in the light of democratization processes in both Western countries and in developing regions. It does so by inserting the globalization-specific extension of voting rights to immigrants and expatriates within the long-term series of historical waves of democratization. Does the current extension enhance democracy by granting de facto disenfranchised immigrants and emigrants political rights or does it jeopardize the very functioning of democracy by undermining its legitimacy through the removal of territorial and national boundaries? The article offers a synthesis of the findings of the volume's contributions in a broad comparative perspective covering both alien and external voting rights in Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America.

This study examined the relationship between German tourists’ trust perceptions and their intention to book a sustainable hotel, pioneering a new quantitative approach to sustainable tourism marketing. Data came from 300 respondents who participated in an online survey. Respondents were given a digital brochure to read containing information about a “fictitious” three-star beach hotel in Portugal, before completing a questionnaire that measured inter alia their intention to book this sustainable hotel. Both individual “general trust” (perception of others’ trustworthiness) and “specific trust” towards the fictitious hotel in the brochure were measured. The survey also evaluated respondents’ perceptions about the usefulness of the information in the brochure. Multiple regression analysis of the data indicated that general trust, trusting the hotel and perceived usefulness of the brochure were positively and significantly related to booking intentions. An interaction between general trust and perceived usefulness was also observed. This means that the higher the perception rate about the brochure's usefulness, the higher general trust was for booking intentions and vice versa.

The last decades have seen an unprecedented increase in the availability of data sets that are inherently global and temporally evolving, from remotely sensed networks to climate model ensembles. This paper provides an overview of statistical modeling techniques for space–time processes, where space is the sphere representing our planet. In particular, we make a distintion between (a) second order‐based approaches and (b) practical approaches to modeling temporally evolving global processes. The former approaches are based on the specification of a class of space–time covariance functions, with space being the two‐dimensional sphere. The latter are based on explicit description of the dynamics of the space–time process, that is, by specifying its evolution as a function of its past history with added spatially dependent noise. We focus primarily on approach (a), for which the literature has been sparse. We provide new models of space–time covariance functions for random fields defined on spheres cross time. Practical approaches (b) are also discussed, with special emphasis on models built directly on the sphere, without projecting spherical coordinates onto the plane. We present a case study focused on the analysis of air pollution from the 2015 wildfires in Equatorial Asia, an event that was classified as the year's worst environmental disaster. The paper finishes with a list of the main theoretical and applied research problems in the area, where we expect the statistical community to engage over the next decade.",15,"

External financing of local public goods can potentially create ‘political resource curses' by reducing citizen oversight, exacerbating elite capture, and producing policy outcomes that are sub-optimal for the general population.

179,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:87012,"Effects of directional environmental change on extinction dynamics in experimental microbial communities are predicted by a simple model
Global temperatures are expected to rise between 1.1 and 6.4°C over the next 100 years, although the exact rate will depend on future greenhouse emissions, and will vary spatially. Temperature can alter an individual's metabolic rate, and consequently birth and death rates. In declining populations, these alterations may manifest as changes in the rate of that population's decline, and subsequently the timing of extinction events. Predicting such events could therefore be of considerable use. We use a small-scale experimental system to investigate how the rate of temperature change can alter a population's time to extinction, and whether it is possible to predict this event using a simple phenomenological model that incorporates information about population dynamics at a constant temperature, published scaling of metabolic rates, and temperature. In addition, we examine 1) the relative importance of the direct effects of temperature on metabolic rate, and the indirect effects (via temperature driven changes in body size), on predictive accuracy (defined as the proximity of the predicted date of extinction to the mean observed date of extinction), 2) the combinations of model parameters that maximise accuracy of predictions, and 3) whether substituting temperature change through time with mean temperature produces accurate predictions. We find that extinction occurs earlier in environments that warm faster, and this can be accurately predicted (R2 > 0.84). Increasing the number of parameters that were temperature-dependent increased the model's accuracy, as did scaling these temperature-dependent parameters with either the direct effects of temperature alone, or with the direct and indirect effects. Using mean temperature through time instead of actual temperature produces less accurate predictions of extinction. These results suggest that simple phenomenological models, incorporating metabolic theory, may be useful in understanding how environmental change can alter a population's rate of extinction.",13,"

The Weddell Sea sector of the Antarctic Ice Sheet is hypothesized to have made a significant contribution to sea-level rise since the Last Glacial Maximum. Using a numerical flowline model we investigate the controls on grounding line motion across the eastern Weddell Sea and compare our results with field data relating to past ice extent. Specifically, we investigate the influence of changes in ice temperature, accumulation, sea level, ice shelf basal melt, and ice shelf buttressing on the dynamics of the Foundation Ice Stream. We find that ice shelf basal melt plays an important role in controlling grounding line advance, while a reduction in ice shelf buttressing is found to be necessary for grounding line retreat. There are two stable positions for the grounding line under glacial conditions: at the northern margin of Berner Island and at the continental shelf break. Global mean sea-level contributions associated with these two scenarios are ~50mm and ~130 mm, respectively. Comparing model results with field evidence from the Pensacola Mountains and the Shackleton Range, we find it unlikely that ice was grounded at the continental shelf break for a prolonged period during the last glacial cycle.

Forced migration is one of the major challenges currently facing the international community. Many refugees have been affected by traumatic experiences at home and during their flight, putting them at a heightened risk of developing trauma-related disorders. The new version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) introduced two sibling disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD). So far, little is known about risk and protective factors in refugees that are specifically associated with the disturbances in self-organization (DSO) characteristic of CPTSD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between PTSD and DSO symptoms and traumatic experiences, postmigration difficulties, and social support in a culturally diverse sample of refugees who resettled in Switzerland. A total of 94 refugees (85.1% male; M age = 31.60 years, SD = 10.14, range: 18-61 years) participated in this study. Trained assessors performed either guided questionnaire assessments or structured interviews. In our advice- and help-seeking sample, 32.9% of individuals suffered from PTSD and 21.3% from CPTSD. After controlling for potential gender differences, we found positive associations between PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure, β = .22, as well as between DSO symptoms and postmigration living difficulties, β = .42, and lack of social support, β = .22. Our findings support the notion that it is highly important to consider differential associations among PTSD and DSO symptoms and risk and protective factors to gain a deeper understanding of the trauma-related problems refugees face.",16,"
The abstract explores the relationship between PTSD and Complex PTSD (CPTSD) symptoms, traumatic experiences, postmigration difficulties, and social support in a diverse refugee population who resettled in Switzerland. The study found that PTSD symptoms were positively associated with trauma exposure, while DSO symptoms (characteristic of CPTSD) were linked to postmigration living difficulties and a lack of social support. The findings suggest that it's crucial to consider differential associations among PTSD and CPTSD symptoms and risk and protective factors to better understand the trauma-related challenges faced by refugees. The study involved 94 refugees, and both guided questionnaire assessments and structured interviews were conducted by trained assessors. Overall, the study highlights the importance of addressing both PTSD and CPTSD symptoms, as well as postmigration difficulties and social support, in the care of refugee populations.","

Aerobic biodegradation half-lives (half-lives) are key parameters used to evaluate pesticide persistence in soil. However, half-life estimates for individual pesticides often span several orders of magnitude, reflecting the impact that various environmental or experimental parameters have on half-lives in soil. In this work, we collected literature-reported half-lives for eleven pesticides along with associated metadata describing the environmental or experimental conditions under which they were derived. We then developed a multivariable framework to discover relationships between the half-lives and associated metadata. We first compared data for the herbicide atrazine collected from 95 laboratory and 65 field studies. We discovered that atrazine application history and soil texture were the parameters that have the largest influence on the observed half-lives in both types of studies. We then extended the analysis to include ten additional pesticides with data collected exclusively from laboratory studies. We found that, when data were available, pesticide application history and biomass concentrations were always positively associated with half-lives. The relevance of other parameters varied among the pesticides, but in some cases the variability could be explained by the physicochemical properties of the pesticides. For example, we found that the relative significance of the organic carbon content of soil for determining half-lives depends on the relative solubility of the pesticide. Altogether, our analyses highlight the reciprocal influence of both environmental parameters and intrinsic physicochemical properties for determining half-lives in soil. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Overall, the multivariable framework developed in this work helps to better understand the complex relationships between environmental parameters and pesticide half-lives in soil.","
This abstract relates to SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being and SDG 15 - Life on Land. While the focus is on studying the environmental parameters that determine the aerobic biodegradation half-lives of pesticides in soil, this research has implications for promoting good health and well-being and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems.

Pesticides are commonly used to control pests and diseases in agriculture, but they can have adverse effects on human health and the environment. The degradation of pesticides in soil is an essential process for their safe and sustainable use. However, the half-lives of pesticides in soil can vary significantly, impacting their persistence and potential risks. By identifying the environmental parameters that impact half-lives, this study can help to optimize pesticide use and minimize potential adverse effects. This is directly related to SDG 3, as pesticide exposure can lead to health problems such as cancer, neurological disorders, and reproductive issues. By understanding the factors that contribute to pesticide persistence, we can work towards minimizing human exposure and promoting good health and well-being.

Additionally, this research contributes to SDG 15, as it aims to promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. Pesticides can have negative impacts on soil health, including reducing soil microbial activity and altering soil structure. By understanding the factors that impact pesticide degradation, we can work towards minimizing their negative impacts on soil health and promoting sustainable land use practices. This is important for promoting life on land and ensuring the long-term health and productivity of terrestrial ecosystems.

Overall, this research helps to advance our understanding of the complex relationships between environmental parameters and pesticide biodegradation, with implications for promoting good health and well-being and sustainable land use practices.","

Through the custom of guardianship, husbands typically have the final word on their wives’ labor supply decisions in Saudi Arabia, a country with very low female labor force participation (FLFP). We provide incentivized evidence (both from an experimental sample in Riyadh and from a national sample) that the vast majority of young married men in Saudi Arabia privately support FLFP outside of home from a normative perspective, while they substantially underestimate the level of support for FLFP by other similar men – even men from their same social setting, such as their neighbors. We then show that randomly correcting these beliefs about others increases married men’s willingness to let their wives join the labor force (as measured by their costly sign-up for a job-matching service for their wives). Finally, we find that this decision maps onto real outcomes: four months after the main intervention, the wives of men in our original sample whose beliefs about acceptability of FLFP were corrected are more likely to have applied and interviewed for a job outside of home. Together, our evidence indicates a potentially important source of labor market frictions, where job search is underprovided due to misperceived social norms.",5,"
The abstract explores the low female labor force participation (FLFP) in Saudi Arabia, attributed to the custom of guardianship, in which husbands have the final say in their wives' labor decisions. The study reveals that while the majority of young married men in Saudi Arabia support FLFP in principle, they significantly underestimate the level of support for FLFP among similar men, even those from the same social setting. The authors suggest that this misperception of social norms creates labor market frictions, as men's beliefs about the acceptability of FLFP influence their wives' job search behavior. The study provides evidence that correcting these misperceptions through an experimental and national sample leads to increased willingness for married men to allow their wives to join the labor force, and translates to real outcomes, with wives of men whose beliefs were corrected being more likely to have applied and interviewed for a job outside of home four months later.","
While the abstract does not explicitly mention the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are implications impacting SDG 5, which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. The study highlights the low FLFP in Saudi Arabia, which is a result of the custom of guardianship, where husbands have the final say in their wives' labor decisions. The authors suggest that misperceived social norms contribute to labor market frictions, as men's beliefs about the acceptability of FLFP influence their wives' job search behavior. The study provides evidence that correcting these misperceptions leads to increased willingness for married men to allow their wives to join the labor force, which could ultimately lead to greater economic opportunities and financial independence for women, contributing to SDG 5. Therefore, the study highlights the importance of addressing misperceived social norms as a way to promote gender equality in the labor market.","

187,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:145143,"Toward a methodical framework for comprehensively assessing forest multifunctionality
Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research has extended its scope from communities that are short-lived or reshape their structure annually to structurally complex forest ecosystems. The establishment of tree diversity experiments poses specific methodological challenges for assessing the multiple functions provided by forest ecosystems. In particular, methodological inconsistencies and nonstandardized protocols impede the analysis of multifunctionality within, and comparability across the increasing number of tree diversity experiments. By providing an overview on key methods currently applied in one of the largest forest biodiversity experiments, we show how methods differing in scale and simplicity can be combined to retrieve consistent data allowing novel insights into forest ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, we discuss and develop recommendations for the integration and transferability of diverse methodical approaches to present and future forest biodiversity experiments. We identified four principles that should guide basic decisions concerning method selection for tree diversity experiments and forest BEF research: (1) method selection should be directed toward maximizing data density to increase the number of measured variables in each plot. (2) Methods should cover all relevant scales of the experiment to consider scale dependencies of biodiversity effects. (3) The same variable should be evaluated with the same method across space and time for adequate larger-scale and longer-time data analysis and to reduce errors due to changing measurement protocols. (4) Standardized, practical and rapid methods for assessing biodiversity and ecosystem functions should be promoted to increase comparability among forest BEF experiments. We demonstrate that currently available methods provide us with a sophisticated toolbox to improve a synergistic understanding of forest multifunctionality. However, these methods require further adjustment to the specific requirements of structurally complex and long-lived forest ecosystems. By applying methods connecting relevant scales, trophic levels, and above- and belowground ecosystem compartments, knowledge gain from large tree diversity experiments can be optimized.",15,"

The metaphorical concepts resilience and post-traumatic growth (PTG) reflect the contemporary Western understanding of overcoming highly challenging life events. However, it is known that across different cultures, a broad range of metaphorical idioms for describing adaptive responses to severe adversity exists. This study aimed to explore and contrast two distinct cultural groups’ culturally shared metaphors for overcoming severe adversities. Fieldwork was conducted in two rural communities: an indigenous Brazilian community that has experienced severe collective adversity and a mountain village in Switzerland that has survived a natural disaster. We carried out separate qualitative metaphor analyses of semistructured interview data from each community. There were some similarities in the metaphorical narratives of the two cultural groups, for example, in metaphors of balance, changed perspective, collective cohesion and life as a journey. The main variations were found in metaphors of magical thinking, equilibrium and organic transformation used by the Brazilian group and metaphors of work, order and material transformation used by the Swiss group. Results from this study suggest that the Western-devised concepts of resilience and PTG can be further expanded, which is highlighted by the variety of culturally shared metaphors. Metaphorical idioms for overcoming severe adversity may be determined by the type of trauma as well as by the sociocultural and historical context.

In terms of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this abstract does not directly address any of the 17 goals. However, it does shed light on the importance of cultural adaptation and contextual sensitivity in psychological interventions, which could have implications for SDGs related to health, education, and economic development.

For example, SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, which could involve the development of culturally appropriate mental health interventions that take into account the unique metaphorical idioms and adaptive responses to adversity within different communities. This could contribute to the overall goal of reducing inequality in health outcomes (SDG 10) and promoting sustainable economic growth (SDG 8).

Similarly, SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. This could involve incorporating culturally relevant metaphors and pedagogical approaches into educational programs, particularly in indigenous communities where traditional knowledge is deeply connected to the environment and cultural practices (SDG 15).

Accelerated discharge through marine-terminating outlet glaciers has been a key component of the rapid mass loss from Arctic glaciers since the 1990s. However, glacier retreat and its climatic controls have not been assessed at the pan-Arctic scale. Consequently, the spatial and temporal variability in the magnitude of retreat, and the possible drivers are uncertain. Here we use remotely sensed data acquired over 273 outlet glaciers, located across the entire Atlantic Arctic (i.e. areas potentially influenced by North Atlantic climate and/or ocean conditions, specifically: Greenland, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and Svalbard), to demonstrate high-magnitude, accelerating and near-ubiquitous retreat between 1992 and 2010. Overall, mean retreat rates increased by a factor of 3.5 between 1992 and 2000 (−30.5 m a−1) and 2000–10 (−105.8 m a−1), with 97% of the study glaciers retreating during the latter period. The Retreat was greatest in northern, western and south-eastern Greenland and also increased substantially on the Barents Sea coast of Novaya Zemlya. Glacier retreat showed no significant or consistent relationship with summer air temperatures at decadal timescales. The rate of frontal position change showed a significant, but weak, correlation with changes in sea-ice concentrations. We highlight large variations in retreat rates within regions and suggest that fjord topography plays an important role.

Group-living animals need to trade off the benefits and the costs of close proximity to conspecifics. Benefits can be increased, and costs reduced by preferentially choosing specific locations within a group best adjusted to an individual’s needs or by associating with specific group members and/or avoiding others. We investigated the spatial structure of meerkat (Suricata suricatta) groups and whether it was shaped by social factors such as affiliation or aggression among group members, predation risk, foraging success, or a mix of these different factors. Using social network analyses, based on spatial networks, we found associations between the dominant pair, among males and among same aged individuals, and dis-assortment by sex only in one to two of the six groups. In addition, the structure of meerkat groups was highly variable, as individual strength within the calculated networks was not repeatable over time. Meerkats seemed to adjust their location to their physical environment, as dominant individuals were located further toward the front of the group, where foraging success is likely higher and young individuals located further toward the back of the group, where they can benefit most from the vigilance effort of their conspecifics. We conclude that meerkat groups display a dynamic spatial structure depending on both the current social and physical environmental.",15,"

SDG 15: Life on Land

The abstract describes a study that investigates the spatial structure of meerkat groups, specifically how social and ecological factors influence their arrangement. Meerkats are a species found in arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, making this study relevant to SDG 15, which aims to promote sustainable land use, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and habitat loss. The study's focus on meerkat groups and their spatial organization suggests that it could contribute to our understanding of how social and ecological factors impact land use patterns and animal behavior in arid regions. By examining how meerkat groups allocate resources and interact within their environment, this study could provide insights into how to conserve and manage these fragile ecosystems.

It is worth mentioning that the study's conclusions suggest that dominant individuals tend to forage in areas with higher success rates, possibly indicating that these individuals have a greater impact on the overall health and survival of the group. This information could have practical applications for conservation efforts, as it could inform land use and management strategies that prioritize the needs of dominant individuals, potentially resulting in more sustainable and resilient populations.

Overall, while SDG 15 is not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, the study's focus on meerkat groups and their behavior in arid environments suggests that it could have relevance to this goal, and further research could help to clarify this relationship.

I must point out that some social and ecological factors mentioned in the abstract, such as social affiliation and aggression, do not necessarily have direct implications for land use or management strategies. Therefore, their contributions to SDG 15 are less clear. However, it is possible that a better understanding of how these factors impact meerkat behavior and group dynamics could provide insights into how to manage and conserve these populations more effectively, potentially contributing to the overall goal of sustainable land use.

In conclusion, while the study's relevance to SDG 15 is not explicitly stated, it has the potential to contribute to our understanding of how social and ecological factors impact land use patterns and animal behavior in arid environments, which is relevant to this SDG.

Globalization exposure increases risk perceptions and demands for social protection among low-skilled individuals, but decreases them among high-skilled individuals. This conditional effect is observationally distinct from classic trade models as well as arguments that deindustrialization or ideology predominantly drive such perceptions and preferences.

This abstract presents a study that explores the impact of globalization on political demand, specifically how it shapes labor market risk perceptions and policy preferences. The study builds on recent developments in trade theory to suggest that globalization does affect political demand, but its effects are not uniform across all individuals. 

The study finds that exposure to globalization increases risk perceptions and demand for social protection among low-skilled individuals, but decreases these factors among high-skilled individuals. This conditional effect is distinct from classic trade models and arguments that deindustrialization or ideology primarily drive these perceptions and preferences. 

The study's empirical analyses, based on cross-national survey data from 16 European countries, demonstrate that exposure to globalization leads to differences in labor market risk perceptions and policy preferences between high- and low-skilled individuals, resulting in variations in these factors. The study focuses on both trade and offshoring and supports the prediction that globalization exposure affects these individuals differently.","
In relation to the Sustainable Development Goals, this study has implications for SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). The study reveals that globalization's impact on political demand is heterogenous, with different effects on high- and low-skilled individuals. This finding suggests that policies aimed at addressing poverty and promoting economic growth should consider the varying effects of globalization on different groups of individuals. Policymakers may need to tailor social protection policies and economic development strategies to better serve low-skilled individuals who may be more susceptible to labor market risks due to globalization. By doing so, these policies could help reduce poverty and promote decent work and economic growth that are inclusive of all individuals. The study's focus on both trade and offshoring also highlights the importance of considering the complex nature of globalization's impact on labor markets and its potential implications for poverty and economic growth.

This study explores how globalization affects political demand, specifically labor market risk perceptions and policy preferences. It suggests that globalization's impact is heterogenous, with different effects on high- and low-skilled individuals. The study reveals that exposure to globalization increases risk perceptions and demand for social protection among low-skilled individuals, while decreasing these factors among high-skilled individuals. This conditional effect is distinct from classic trade models and arguments that deindustrialization or ideology primarily drive these perceptions and preferences. The study's empirical analyses, based on cross-national survey data from 16 European countries, demonstrate that exposure to globalization leads to differences in labor market risk perceptions and policy preferences between high- and low-skilled individuals. The study's focus on both trade and offshoring highlights the importance of considering the complex nature of globalization's impact on labor markets. Policymakers should tailor social protection policies and economic development strategies to better serve low-skilled individuals who may be more susceptible to labor market risks due to globalization. This study contributes to SDGs 1 (No Poverty), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by shedding light on how globalization affects these individuals' demand for social protection and policy preferences, which could contribute to reducing poverty, promoting decent work and economic growth, and informing policy decisions related to industry, innovation, and infrastructure.","

It is expected that an increasing proportion of the precipitation will fall as rain in alpine catchments in the future. Consequently, snow storage is expected to decrease, which, together with changes in snowmelt rates and timing, might cause reductions in spring and summer low flows. The objectives of this study were (1) to simulate the effect of changing snow storage on low flows during the warm seasons and (2) to relate drought sensitivity to the simulated snow storage changes at different elevations. The Swiss Climate Change Scenarios 2011 data set was used to derive future changes in air temperature and precipitation. A typical bucket‐type catchment model, HBV‐light, was applied to 14 mountain catchments in Switzerland to simulate streamflow and snow in the reference period and three future periods. The largest relative decrease in annual maximum SWE was simulated for elevations below 2,200 m a.s.l. (60–75% for the period 2070–2099) and the snowmelt season shifted by up to 4 weeks earlier. The relative decrease in spring and summer minimum runoff that was caused by the relative decrease in maximum SWE (i.e., elasticity), reached 40–90% in most of catchments for the reference period and decreased for the future periods. This decreasing elasticity indicated that the effect of snow on summer low flows is reduced in the future. The fraction of snowmelt runoff in summer decreased by more than 50% at the highest elevations and almost disappeared at the lowest elevations. This might have large implications on water availability during the summer.",6,"
The abstract discusses the projected changes in snowpack and their impacts on summer low flows in alpine catchments due to an increase in rainfall and decreased snow storage.

The authors calibrate the model to the US economy and find that it accurately reflects the paths of the skill premium, the labor share, and labor productivity. This model offers a new understanding of recent income distribution trends, which can be explained endogenously.","
While this abstract does not explicitly focus on sustainable development or the SDGs, it does touch on themes related to SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, as well as SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities.

The model presented in the abstract highlights the impact of automation and horizontal innovation on the labor market and income distribution, which can have implications for both economic growth and income inequality. Automation, while increasing productivity, can also lead to job displacement and lower wages for low-skilled workers. Horizontal innovation, on the other hand, can create new products and opportunities for higher-skilled workers, resulting in a higher skill premium.

These dynamics can have both positive and negative effects on economic growth and income inequality. Automation can lead to increased economic output and growth, as machines can work around the clock without the need for breaks or holidays. However, if the benefits of automation are not distributed equitably, it can exacerbate income inequality and lead to social unrest. Horizontal innovation can also promote economic growth by creating new products and opportunities for higher-skilled workers, but again, if these benefits are not shared equitably, it can widen income disparities.

In terms of SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, the model presented in the abstract highlights the importance of addressing income inequality through policies that promote equitable distribution of the benefits of automation and horizontal innovation. This could include initiatives to retrain low-skilled workers for jobs that cannot be automated, as well as measures to ensure that the benefits of horizontal innovation are shared more equitably, such as tax policies that promote income redistribution or policies that promote the formation of cooperatives and worker-owned businesses.

In conclusion, while this abstract does not explicitly focus on sustainable development or the SDGs, it touches on themes related to SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, as well as SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, highlighting the importance of addressing income inequality and promoting equitable distribution of the benefits of automation and horizontal innovation. Policymakers should consider these implications as they develop strategies to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce income inequality.","
SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
The abstract and model presented in this research aligns with SDG 8 as it focuses on economic growth, productivity, and employment. Automation and horizontal innovation are critical drivers of economic growth, and the model suggests that automation leads to a decline in the labor share, which could result in job displacement. However, the model also shows that rising low-skill wages lead to an increase in the share of automation innovations, indicating a potential path for reskilling and upskilling workers to meet the demands of the new technology. Therefore, policymakers can use this model to inform policies that promote job creation and reskilling programs to ensure that workers benefit from the growth in productivity resulting from automation and horizontal innovation.

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
The model explores the role of innovation, particularly horizontal innovation, in driving economic growth. This aligns with SDG 9, which aims to promote research and development, technology transfer, and the establishment of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education programs. By understanding the relationship between automation, horizontal innovation, and income inequality, policymakers can design policies that promote innovation while minimizing the negative impacts on income distribution.

SDG 15: Life on Land
While the abstract does not explicitly mention SDG 15, it does have implications for this goal. The impact of automation on the labor share and income distribution could result in land use changes, as wealthier individuals move to areas with lower density and better amenities. This could lead to the displacement of low-income communities, further exacerbating inequality. Policymakers can use this model to inform policies that promote equitable land use planning and mitigate the negative impacts of automation and income inequality on communities.

In conclusion, the abstract and model presented in this research aligns with SDGs 8, 9, and 15. The results provide insights into the relationship between automation, horizontal innovation, and income inequality and offer potential policy solutions to mitigate negative impacts. Policymakers can use this model to inform policies that promote job creation, reskilling, innovation, and equitable land use planning to ensure that the benefits of economic growth and productivity resulting from automation and horizontal innovation are shared equitably among all members of society.","

196,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:139433,"Genetics of dispersal
Dispersal is a process of central importance for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations and communities, because of its diverse consequences for gene flow and demography. It is subject to evolutionary change, which begs the question, what is the genetic basis of this potentially complex trait? To address this question, we (i) review the empirical literature on the genetic basis of dispersal, (ii) explore how theoretical investigations of the evolution of dispersal have represented the genetics of dispersal, and (iii) discuss how the genetic basis of dispersal influences theoretical predictions of the evolution of dispersal and potential consequences. Dispersal has a detectable genetic basis in many organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. Generally, there is evidence for significant genetic variation for dispersal or dispersal-related phenotypes or evidence for the micro-evolution of dispersal in natural populations. Dispersal is typically the outcome of several interacting traits, and this complexity is reflected in its genetic architecture: while some genes of moderate to large effect can influence certain aspects of dispersal, dispersal traits are typically polygenic. Correlations among dispersal traits as well as between dispersal traits and other traits under selection are common, and the genetic basis of dispersal can be highly environment-dependent. By contrast, models have historically considered a highly simplified genetic architecture of dispersal. It is only recently that models have started to consider multiple loci influencing dispersal, as well as non-additive effects such as dominance and epistasis, showing that the genetic basis of dispersal can influence evolutionary rates and outcomes, especially under non-equilibrium conditions. For example, the number of loci controlling dispersal can influence projected rates of dispersal evolution during range shifts and corresponding demographic impacts. Incorporating more realism in the genetic architecture of dispersal is thus necessary to enable models to move beyond the purely theoretical towards making more useful predictions of evolutionary and ecological dynamics under current and future environmental conditions. To inform these advances, empirical studies need to answer outstanding questions concerning whether specific genes underlie dispersal variation, the genetic architecture of context-dependent dispersal phenotypes and behaviours, and correlations among dispersal and other traits.",15,"
The abstract discusses the genetics of dispersal, a crucial process in population and community dynamics. It highlights the empirical evidence for a genetic basis of dispersal in various organisms, as well as the polygenic and environment-dependent nature of this trait's genetic architecture. The article also explores how theoretical investigations have represented the genetics of dispersal and how it affects the evolution of dispersal. Key findings suggest that the genetic basis of dispersal influences evolutionary rates and outcomes, particularly under non-equilibrium conditions. Empirical studies need to uncover specific genes, genetic architecture, and correlations with other traits to inform future advances in modeling the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of dispersal under changing environmental conditions.","
In relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the discussion of the genetics of dispersal in this abstract has implications for several SDGs. Dispersal is crucial for the survival and conservation of species, particularly in the context of climate change and habitat loss. The genetic basis of dispersal can influence the ability of species to adapt to changing environments and migrate to more suitable habitats (SDG 13: Climate Action). The polygenic and environment-dependent nature of dispersal genetics suggests that conservation efforts should consider the genetic variability and context-dependence of dispersal (SDG 15: Life on Land). Additionally, the role of dispersal in gene flow and demography highlights the importance of maintaining connectivity between habitats to prevent genetic isolation and the loss of genetic variability (SDG 15: Life on Land). The recognition that models need to incorporate more realism in the genetic architecture of dispersal to accurately predict evolutionary and ecological dynamics under current and future environmental conditions (SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals) also underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaborations between empirical researchers, modelers, and conservation practitioners. Therefore, this abstract contributes to several SDGs by highlighting the importance of understanding the genetics of dispersal for conservation and sustainable development.","
SDG 14: Life Below Water
Although the abstract does not explicitly address SDG 14, it does mention the importance of dispersal in ecological dynamics. Dispersal plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, as many marine species have complex life cycles that involve different stages in different environments. Genetic variation in dispersal traits can have significant impacts on the distribution and abundance of marine species, which can in turn affect ecosystem functioning and resilience. Therefore, understanding the genetics of dispersal is important for the sustainable management of marine resources and the conservation of marine species.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The abstract's discussion of the genetics of dispersal is highly relevant to SDG 15, as dispersal is a key process for the conservation and management of terrestrial ecosystems. Genetic variation in dispersal traits can impact the persistence and distribution of plant and animal species, which can have significant ecological and evolutionary consequences. Understanding the genetic basis of dispersal is essential for the development of conservation strategies, as it can inform the design of habitat networks and the management of populations to ensure their long-term survival.

In summary, while the abstract does not explicitly address SDGs 14 and 15, it highlights the importance of dispersal in ecological dynamics, which is relevant to the conservation and sustainable management of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. As such, the abstract is relevant to these SDGs.","

To date, technical and economic criteria have become the main benchmarks used in assessing the substitution potential of new materials. Sustainable product design uses multi-criteria decision methods to select the best material or process from a set of alternatives, requiring that the target product is already known. This paper follows a contrary approach by introducing the Multi-Perspective Application Selection, a method to support researchers and industrial practitioners alike in identifying and choosing the most promising and sustainable applications for new materials under development. This is achieved through combining and assessing technical, economic and environmental criteria covering the entire life cycle of an application. With this method, numerous possible applications can be screened during the early stages of material development when little information is available. The results help to narrow the selection of feasible products by excluding unpromising applications. The first step involves identifying and segmenting potential markets. In the second step, technical and economic aspects are assessed by employing user acceptance criteria. Finally, simplified life cycle assessment calculations are implemented in the third step to cover environmental considerations. Using an example of cellulose nanofiber reinforced composites, the authors illustrate the procedure whereby luxury consumer goods, specialty vehicles, industrial processing and furniture result as the most promising applications identified from this new method. The results give the researchers a more holistic understanding of their material and help to establish the requirements that the material must fulfill for the selected application. With that knowledge, the method can help enact development pathways in applied materials research.",12,"

Pm3 from wheat encodes a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat type of receptor and confers resistance to powdery mildew caused by the fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt). Each of the 17 functional Pm3 alleles identified so far confers resistance to a distinct spectrum of Bgt isolates. Variant Pm3e has been found in wheat donor line W150 and differs only by two amino acids from the non-functional variant Pm3CS. In order to evaluate the capability of Pm3e to provide powdery mildew field resistance, we generated transgenic Pm3e lines by biolistic transformation of the powdery mildew susceptible spring wheat cultivar Bobwhite. Field trials conducted during four field seasons in Switzerland showed significant and strong powdery mildew resistance of the Pm3e transgenic lines, whereas the corresponding biological sister lines, not containing the transgene, were severely powdery mildew infected. Thus Pm3e alone is responsible for the strong resistance phenotype. The field grown transgenic lines showed high transgene expression and Pm3e protein accumulation with no fitness costs on plant development and yield associated with Pm3e abundance. Line E#1 as well as sister line E#1 showed delayed flowering due to somaclonal variation. The study shows the capability of Pm3e in providing strong powdery mildew field resistance, making its use in wheat breeding programs very promising.",2,"

By changing soil properties, plants can modify their growth environment. Although the soil microbiota is known to play a key role in the resulting plant-soil feedbacks, the proximal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown. We found that benzoxazinoids, a class of defensive secondary metabolites that are released by roots of cereals such as wheat and maize, alter root-associated fungal and bacterial communities, decrease plant growth, increase jasmonate signaling and plant defenses, and suppress herbivore performance in the next plant generation. Complementation experiments demonstrate that the benzoxazinoid breakdown product 6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2-one (MBOA), which accumulates in the soil during the conditioning phase, is both sufficient and necessary to trigger the observed phenotypic changes. Sterilization, fungal and bacterial profiling and complementation experiments reveal that MBOA acts indirectly by altering root-associated microbiota.

202,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157456,"Long-term Investment Choices for Quinoa Farmers in Puno, Peru: A Real Options Case Study
The goal of this article is to assess the optimal choices of a smallholder quinoa farmer in the Puno region of Peru, in terms of his decision if and when to undertake certain investments that are expected to increase quinoa yield and crop resistance to harsh weather conditions, such as frost. We focus on two irreversible options, namely quinoa variety management andWaruWaru. The former alternative considers the option of the farmer to switch from his business-as-usual quinoa variety to one that has different yield and frost resistance characteristics. The latter alternative refers to the implementation of an ancestral cultivation practice that is estimated to offer benefits in terms of yield increase and resistance to harsh climate conditions.
We rely on Real Options Analysis to assess the two types of investment opportunities for the farmer. This approach allows us to determine not only whether the investments should be undertaken or not, but also the optimal timing to do so. We find that one quinoa variety (Kancolla) offers the highest benefits to the farmer and switching to this option should be immediate if investment costs are low; however, as costs increase, the decision to switch quinoa variety is optimally postponed until quinoa price uncertainty is reduced. We find that the Waru Waru option is not worth undertaking unless further evidence related to the increase in the productivity of quinoa is developed. However, at increases in productivity above 20%, the Waru Waru option becomes highly attractive. The article also discusses how quinoa price dynamics, yield sensitivity to frost, and governmental support impact decisions of the smallholder farmer.",2,"

203,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:124568,"Microbes and asthma: Opportunities for intervention
The worldwide incidence and prevalence of asthma continues to increase. Asthma is now understood as an umbrella term for different phenotypes or endotypes, which arise through different pathophysiologic pathways. Understanding the many factors contributing to development of the disease is important for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of certain asthma phenotypes. The hygiene hypothesis has been formulated to explain the increasing prevalence of allergic disease, including asthma. This hypothesis postulates that decreased exposure at a young age to certain infectious agents as a result of improved hygiene, increased antibiotic use and vaccination, and changes in lifestyle and dietary habits is associated with changes in the immune system, which predispose subjects to allergy. Many microbes, during their coevolution with human subjects, developed mechanisms to manipulate the human immune system and to increase their chances of survival. Improving models of asthma, as well as choosing adequate end points in clinical trials, will lead to a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms, thus providing an opportunity to devise primary and secondary interventions at the same time as identifying new molecular targets for treatment. This article reports the discussion and conclusion of a workshop under the auspices of the Netherlands Lung Foundation to extend our understanding of how modulation of the immune system by bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections might affect the development of asthma and to map out future lines of investigation.",3,"

A physically active lifestyle is a key component of promoting health and well-being particularly for healthy ageing. Most sensor-based studies are focused on measuring the level (or intensity) of physical activity and use data collected using a specific study protocol under a controlled laboratory condition and are thus hardly comparable to each other and difficult to use as training or validation data for real-life studies. Therefore, it is important to have available a reference dataset for physical activity type classification especially in real-life environments. The main aim of this study is to provide a study design for collecting a reference dataset that can maximize both internal and ecological validity of measuring physical activity types. To that end, we designed study protocols in three different conditions, namely: laboratory/controlled, semi-structured and real life. To collect data, a sample of 40 healthy participants (30 younger adults and 10 older adults) will participate to perform activities including: lying, sitting, standing, walking on level ground, running, cycling, walking uphill, walking downhill, walking downstairs and walking upstairs both indoors and outdoors. The activity walking on level ground will be performed at three different speeds. Additionally, GPS and GIS methods (e.g. information about slope or dominant land use) will be used to enrich the detailed information about accelerometry-based activity types and to provide the environmental information of the place where the activities will take place. The proposed reference dataset can be useful for future validation and comparison studies and for the development of new physical activity type classifications algorithms particularly under real-life conditions.",3,"

Child maltreatment is known to engender negative emotional and behavioral consequences. Although neglect is the most frequent form of maltreatment, it has thus far only received little attention, especially when looking at low-resource countries. The current study investigated possible associations between neglect and internalizing and externalizing problems. As neglect and abuse often co-occur, the latter was controlled for. In total, 409 Tanzanian primary school students (52% boys, M = 10.5 years, range = 6-15) participated in the cross-sectional study. Structured clinical interviews were conducted assessing maltreatment, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Overall, 31% (n = 128) of the children reported at least one type of physical neglect and 31% (n = 127) of emotional neglect. Using structural equation modeling, we found a significant association between neglect and internalizing (β = 0.59, p < .01) and externalizing problems (β = 0.35, p < .05). However, these associations could only be detected in younger children (ages 6-9), whereas in older children (ages 10-15), mental health problems were significantly related to violence and abuse.

The aim of this study was to explore the role of character strengths and their associations to life satisfaction in older people. We were interested in studying several transitions that are specific for older people: aging, retirement, living alone, and being widowed. We examined the relationships of these demographic characteristics and living conditions with character strengths and studied their effects on the association of character strengths with life satisfaction. In a cross-sectional analysis, 15,598 older adults (aged 46–93 years) who had completed measures on character strengths, life satisfaction, and demographic characteristics and living conditions were selected from an existing database. Overall, analyses revealed positive associations of most character strengths with age, and higher scores in most character strengths for the employed (vs. the retired) and those living with a partner (vs. those living alone), while only few relationships with being widowed (vs. being married) were observed. Further, the contribution of character strengths to life satisfaction generally decreased slightly with age, but increased for certain character strengths, such as modesty or prudence. Also, stronger relationships between several character strengths and life satisfaction were found for retired people and those living alone, while being widowed did not affect these relationships. The results demonstrate how character strengths might contribute to the life satisfaction of older adults in various living conditions and thereby offer a starting point for strengths-based programs in later life.",3,"
This study investigates the relationship between character strengths and life satisfaction in older adults, while taking into account different demographic characteristics and living conditions. The authors examine how aging, retirement, living alone, and widowhood affect these relationships. The study's findings suggest that most character strengths are positively associated with age, and employed individuals and those living with a partner have higher scores in most character strengths than retired individuals and those living alone, respectively. However, being widowed did not significantly impact most character strengths. Additionally, the relationship between character strengths and life satisfaction generally decreased with age, although it increased for certain character strengths, such as modesty and prudence. Retired individuals and those living alone showed stronger relationships between several character strengths and life satisfaction than those who were widowed. These results highlight the role of character strengths in promoting life satisfaction for older adults in various living conditions and suggest potential implications for strengths-based programs in later life.","

207,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:148344,"Chronic disruptive pain in emerging adults with and without chronic health conditions and the moderating role of psychiatric disorders: Evidence from a population-based cross-sectional survey in Canada
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There has been a growth in the proportion of emerging adults vulnerable to pain-related sequelae of chronic health conditions (CHCs). Given the paucity of research during this important developmental period, this study investigated the association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain among emerging adults and the extent to which psychiatric disorders moderate this association.
METHODS: Data come from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health (CCHS-MH). This cross-sectional survey included 5987 participants that were 15-30 years of age and self-reported their CHCs (n=2460, 41%) and the extent to which pain impacted daily functioning using items from the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI 3). Group comparisons between respondents with CHCs and healthy controls were made using chi-square tests. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed from ordinal logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Product-term interactions between CHCs and psychiatric disorders were included in the models to explore moderating effects. All analyses were weighted to maintain representativeness of the study sample to the Canadian population.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 23.5 (SE 0.1) years and 48% were female. Compared to healthy controls, a greater proportion of participants with CHCs reported having chronic pain (20.3% vs. 4.5%, p<0.001). Among those with chronic pain, respondents with CHCs reported a greater number of activities prevented because of chronic disruptive pain (χ2=222.28, p<0.001). Similarly, in logistic regression models, participants with CHCs had greater odds of reporting chronic disruptive pain (OR=4.94, 95% CI=4.08-5.99). Alcohol (β=-0.66; p=0.025) and drug abuse/dependence disorders (β=-1.24; p=0.012) were found to moderate the association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain. Specifically, the probability of chronic disruptive pain was higher for emerging adults without CHCs and with alcohol or drug disorders; however, among participants with CHCs, probability was higher for those without these disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a robust association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain. The moderating effects suggest that alcohol or drug disorders are especially harmful for emerging adults without CHCs and contribute to higher levels of chronic disruptive pain; however, among those with CHCs, alcohol and illicit drugs may be used as a numbing agent to blunt chronic disruptive pain.
IMPLICATIONS: Findings from this study have implications for the integration and coordination of services to design strategies aimed at managing chronic disruptive pain and preventing pain-related disabilities later in life. Within the health system, healthcare providers should engage in dialogues about mental health and substance use regularly with emerging adults, be proactive in screening for psychiatric disorders, and continue to monitor the impact of pain on daily functioning. Given the age range of emerging adults, there is tremendous opportunity for clinicians to work cooperatively with colleagues in the education system to support emerging adults with and without CHCs. Overall, clinicians, researchers, educators, and those in social services should continue to be mindful of the complex interrelationships between physical and mental health and chronic disruptive pain and work cooperatively to optimize health outcomes and prevent pain-related disabilities among emerging adults.",3,"

208,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:148159,"Amylin - its role in the homeostatic and hedonic control of eating and recent developments of amylin analogs to treat obesity
BACKGROUND: Amylin is a pancreatic β-cell hormone that produces effects in several different organ systems. One of its best-characterized effects is the reduction in eating and body weight seen in preclinical and clinical studies. Amylin activates specific receptors, a portion of which it shares with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Amylin's role in the control of energy metabolism relates to its satiating effect, but recent data indicate that amylin may also affect hedonic aspects in the control of eating, including a reduction of the rewarding value of food. Recently, several amylin-based peptides have been characterized. Pramlintide (Symlin®) is currently the only one being used clinically to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However other amylin analogs with improved pharmacokinetic properties are being considered as anti-obesity treatment strategies. Several other studies in obesity have shown that amylin agonists could also be useful for weight loss, especially in combination with other agents.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review will briefly summarize amylin physiology and pharmacology and then focus on amylin's role in food reward and the effects of amylin analogs in pre-clinical testing for anti-obesity drugs.
CONCLUSION: We propose here that the effects of amylin may be homeostatic and hedonic in nature.",3,"

Overall, the abstract summarizes the physiology and pharmacology of amylin and its potential as an anti-obesity drug.","
Based on the provided core themes, I will analyze the abstract in relation to the SDGs.

This abstract discusses the potential of amylin, a pancreatic hormone, to control eating behavior and weight. While the direct impact of amylin on sustainable development may not be immediately apparent, I will identify phrases, concepts, insights, or implications impacting any of the 17 SDGs based on the following core themes:

1. Reduced Hunger (SDG 2)
Amylin reduces eating and body weight, which could potentially alleviate hunger and contribute to SDG 2's goal of ending hunger and achieving food security.

2. Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3)
Amylin's role in controlling eating behavior and weight could also contribute to SDG 3's goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all. This could potentially lead to a decrease in health issues related to overweight and obesity, such as diabetes and heart disease.

3. Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12)
The development of amylin analogs as anti-obesity treatment strategies could potentially contribute to SDG 12's goal of ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. By promoting the responsible consumption of food, these analogs could potentially help reduce food waste and contribute to a more sustainable food system.

4. Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17)
The development and testing of amylin-based peptides as potential anti-obesity drugs involves collaboration and partnerships between researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory bodies. This aligns with SDG 17's goal of strengthening global partnerships for sustainable development.

While the abstract does not directly contribute to all 17 SDGs, the potential impact of amylin-based peptides on hunger, health, and consumption patterns suggests a potential contribution to several SDGs. As such, while this abstract does not require a specific designation for SDG relevance, it does have implications for SDGs 2, 3, and 12.","
The abstract presents potential contributions to SDGs 3 and 15.

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
Amylin's role in controlling eating behavior and weight reduction through its satiating effect and potential reduction in the rewarding value of food has implications for managing obesity, a leading cause of preventable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the development of amylin analogs with improved pharmacokinetic properties for treating obesity aligns with SDG 3's objective of promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing and treating non-communicable diseases.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The review's mention of the reduction in the rewarding value of food is notable because it suggests that amylin's effect may not only be a homeostatic but also a hedonic one. This finding adds to the growing body of research on how food reward affects health and well-being, which is crucial in addressing the challenges associated with unhealthy diets and obesity. Moreover, the promotion of sustainable agriculture and food production practices is essential for promoting healthy diets and addressing food insecurity, which are significant contributors to malnutrition and other health issues.

In conclusion, the abstract presents a potential contribution to SDGs 3 and 15 through the development of amylin analogs as anti-obesity drugs and the growing understanding of the hedonic effects of food reward. However, it's essential to note that the evaluation is preliminary and requires further research to confirm the findings' generalizability and clinical implications.","

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease reported worldwide. In Uganda, seropositivity has been reported in both humans and domesticated animals, including cattle. However, it remains unknown whether cattle are shedding leptospires and thus acting as potential source for human leptospirosis. We conducted this cross-sectional study in two cattle abattoirs in Kampala, Uganda between June and July 2017. Kidney and urine samples from 500 cattle sourced from across the country were analysed by real-time PCR to establish the prevalence of Leptospira-positive cattle and risk of exposure to abattoir workers. The species of infecting Leptospira was determined by amplification of secY gene and compared to reference sequences published in GenBank. Of 500 cattle tested, 36 (7.2%) had Leptospira DNA in their kidneys (carriers), 29 (5.8%) in their urine (shedders); with an overall prevalence (kidney and/or urine) of 8.8%. Leptospira borgpetersenii was confirmed as the infecting species in three cattle and Leptospira kirschneri in one animal. Male versus female cattle (OR = 3, p-value 0.003), exotic versus local breeds (OR = 21.3, p-value 0.002) or cattle from Western Uganda (OR = 4.4, p-value 0.001) and from regions across the border (OR = 3.3, p-value 0.032) versus from the central region were more likely to be Leptospira-positive. The daily risk of exposure of abattoir workers to ≥1 (kidney and/or urine) positive carcass ranged from 27% (95% credibility interval 18.6-52.3) to 100% (95% CI 91.0-100.0), with halal butchers and pluck inspectors being at highest risk. In conclusion, cattle slaughtered at abattoirs in Uganda carry and shed pathogenic Leptospira species; and this may pose occupation-related risk of exposure among workers in these abattoirs, with workers who handle larger numbers of animals being at higher risk.",3,"
The abstract discusses bovine leptospirosis in cattle abattoirs in Uganda. The study, conducted in two abattoirs in Kampala in 2017, aimed to determine the prevalence of Leptospira-positive cattle and the risk of exposure for abattoir workers. Real-time PCR was used to analyze kidney and urine samples from 500 cattle sourced from across Uganda. Leptospira borgpetersenii and kirschneri were identified as infecting species in some cattle. The study found that male cattle, exotic breeds, and cattle from Western Uganda or regions across the border were more likely to be Leptospira-positive. The daily risk of exposure for abattoir workers ranged from 27% to 100%, with workers who handled larger numbers of animals being at higher risk. In conclusion, the study revealed that cattle slaughtered at abattoirs in Uganda carry and shed pathogenic Leptospira species, posing a potential occupational risk for abattoir workers.","
This abstract relates to several SDGs, particularly SDGs 3, 6, and 8. 

SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being: The study aims to understand the prevalence of Leptospira in cattle, a bacterial disease that causes leptospirosis, which is a zoonotic disease that affects both humans and animals. The study highlights that in Uganda, both humans and domesticated animals, including cattle, have been reported to have seropositivity to leptospirosis. However, it remains unknown whether cattle are shedding leptospires and thus acting as potential sources for human leptospirosis. This study helps to address this knowledge gap and contributes to our understanding of the health risks associated with leptospirosis in both humans and animals.

SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation: The study focuses on cattle abattoirs in Uganda, where Leptospira is identified in both the kidneys and urine of cattle. The study demonstrates that cattle slaughtered at these abattoirs may pose a risk of exposure for abattoir workers, as Leptospira can be found in both the kidneys and urine of infected animals. This highlights the importance of ensuring safe and hygienic practices in abattoirs to minimize the risk of exposure to Leptospira for workers.

SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth: The study also emphasizes the risk of exposure for abattoir workers, with workers who handle larger numbers of animals being at higher risk. This highlights the need to prioritize worker safety and provide adequate training and protective equipment to minimize the risk of exposure to Leptospira. The study also suggests that halal butchers and pluck inspectors are at higher risk of exposure, indicating the need for targeted interventions to mitigate these risks. 

Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the health risks associated with leptospirosis in both humans and animals and highlights the need for safe and hygienic practices in abattoirs to minimize the risk of exposure to Leptospira for workers. This aligns with SDGs 3, 6, and 8, which aim to promote good health, ensure access to clean water and sanitation, and provide decent work and economic growth.","
The abstract discussed in this evaluation is relevant to SDGs 2, 3, and 15.

SDG 2: Zero Hunger
Although not directly related to SDG 2, the study's findings on the prevalence of Leptospira in cattle in Uganda may have indirect implications for hunger eradication efforts. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that can cause severe illness and death, particularly in people with weakened immune systems. In Uganda, where hunger and malnutrition remain significant challenges, people living in poverty and undernourished may be more susceptible to the disease. Therefore, understanding the transmission dynamics of Leptospira in cattle and their potential contribution to human infection could help inform public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing the burden of foodborne diseases, thus contributing to the eradication of hunger and malnutrition.

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
The study's findings directly relate to SDG 3, as they highlight the potential health risks associated with the slaughter and processing of cattle in Uganda. The study found that approximately 9% of the tested cattle were Leptospira-positive, and the daily risk of exposure to abattoir workers ranged from 27% to 100%. These findings suggest that abattoir workers are at significant risk of exposure to Leptospira, particularly those who handle larger numbers of animals. The study's results could inform policies and interventions aimed at mitigating occupational health risks in the agricultural sector, particularly in abattoirs, thus contributing to the promotion of good health and well-being.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The study's findings also relate to SDG 15, as they highlight the potential impact of cattle transmission on wildlife and ecosystems. Leptospira is a bacterial pathogen that can infect a wide range of mammalian hosts, including wild animals and domestic livestock. The study found that male cattle, exotic breeds, and cattle from Western Uganda or regions across the border were more likely to be Leptospira-positive. These findings suggest that the transmission dynamics of Leptospira in Uganda may involve wildlife reservoirs and/or interregional cattle movements. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential ecological and epidemiological implications","
The study presented in the abstract contributes to the advancement of SDGs 3, 6, and 8 by addressing the health risks associated with Leptospira in cattle slaughtered at abattoirs in Uganda. The study highlights the potential occupational risks for abattoir workers, with workers handling larger numbers of animals being at higher risk.

Female leaders continue to face bias in the workplace compared to male leaders. When employees are evaluated differently because of who they are rather than how they perform, an ethical dilemma arises for leaders and organizations. Thus, bridging role congruity and social identity leadership theories, we propose that gender biases in leadership evaluations can be overcome by manipulating diversity at the team level. Across two multiple-source, multiple-wave, and randomized field experiments, we test whether team gender composition restores gender equity in leadership evaluations. In Study 1, we find that male leaders are rated as more prototypical in male-dominated groups, an advantage that is eliminated in gender-balanced groups. In Study 2, we replicate and extend this finding by showing that leader gender and team gender composition interact to predict trust in the leader via perceptions of leader prototypicality. The results show causal support for the social identity model of organizational leadership and a boundary condition of role congruity theory. Beyond moral arguments of fairness, our findings also show how, in the case of gender, team diversity can create a more level playing field for leaders. Finally, we outline the implications of our results for leaders, organizations, business ethics, and society.",5,"

Such efforts will lead to a more diverse and innovative workforce, contributing to SDG 15's goal of promoting innovation and infrastructure.

Moreover, the study's findings suggest that promoting gender equality in education and the labor market can contribute to sustainable and inclusive economic growth. A more diverse workforce can lead to a more innovative and productive labor force, promoting SDG 8's goal of promoting economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.

In summary, the study's findings underscore the importance of promoting gender equality in education and the labor market, and fostering innovation and infrastructure to bridge the gender gap in STEM fields. Policymakers, educators, and employers should prioritize these issues to promote sustainable development and contribute to SDG 5 and SDG 15.","

Ceria is among the most prominent materials for generating clean fuels through solar thermochemical CO2 reduction and water splitting. The main optimization parameter for ceria in solar reactors is the oxygen exchange capacity (OEC, Dd), which can be notably improved through various dopant types. Among them, tetravalent dopants excel through the formation of active vacancies which lead to particularly high OEC values. We thus performed a comprehensive screening evaluation of all dopants in the periodic table which have been reported to adopt an oxidation state of +IV. All thermally stable doped ceria samples, M0.1Ce0.9O2d (M ¼ Si, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Rh, Hf, Ta, Nb, V, Pr, and Tb), were first analyzed for Dd improvement with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Dopant solubility limits and behavior in the ceria host lattice was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX) and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. No indications for carbonate side product formation were found. Hf-, Zr-, and Ta-doped ceria display higher OEC than pristine ceria, and Raman spectroscopy indicated that their improved performance is accompanied by a higher versatility in the underlying vacancy formation processes. Furthermore, the effective dopant radii are close to an optimal dopant radius around 0.8 °A for maximum Dd according to TGA cycling experiments. These experimentally derived trends for doped ceria were supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations which analogously correlate Dd with the partial electronic charge of the metal dopants.",7,"

[abstract]""New Earth-abundant Materials for Large-scale Solar Fuels Generation
The solar resource is immense, but the power density of light striking the Earth's surface is relatively dilute, necessitating large area solar conversion devices in order to harvest substantial amounts of power for renewable energy applications. In addition, energy storage is a key challenge for intermittent renewable resources such as solar and wind, which adds significant cost to these energies. As the majority of humanity's present-day energy consumption is based on fuels, an ideal solution is to generate renewable fuels from abundant resources such as sunlight and water. In this account, we detail our recent work towards generating highly efficient and stable Earth-abundant semiconducting materials for solar water splitting to generate renewable hydrogen fuel.""[/abstract]

We consider the problem of adaptive home heating in the smart grid, assuming that real-time electricity prices are being exposed to end-users with the goal of realizing demand-side management. To lower the burden on the end-users, our goal is the design of a smart thermostat that automatically heats the home, optimally trading o the user’s comfort and cost.

The gains from insurance arise from the transfer of income across states. Yet, by requiring that the premium be paid upfront, standard insurance products also transfer income across time. We show that this intertemporal transfer can help explain low insurance demand, especially among the poor, and in a randomized control trial in Kenya we test a crop insurance product which removes it. The product is interlinked with a contract farming scheme: as with other inputs, the buyer of the crop offers the insurance and deducts the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The take-up rate for pay-at-harvest insurance is 72 percent, compared to 5 percent for the standard pay-up-front contract, and the difference is largest among poorer farmers. Additional experiments and outcomes provide evidence on the role of liquidity constraints, present bias, and counterparty risk, and find that enabling farmers to commit to pay the premium just one month later increases demand by 21 percentage points.",8,"
This abstract explores the impact of time versus state in insurance, specifically in the context of contract farming in Kenya. The study finds that the requirement to pay premiums upfront can lead to low insurance demand, particularly among the poor. The authors propose a pay-at-harvest insurance product, which is linked to a contract farming scheme, to address this issue. This product allows the buyer of the crop to offer insurance and deduct the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The experiment results show a significant increase in insurance demand, with a take-up rate of 72% for the pay-at-harvest product compared to 5% for the standard pay-up-front contract. The difference in demand is largest among poorer farmers. Additional experiments and outcomes suggest that liquidity constraints, present bias, and counterparty risk all play a role in insurance demand. The authors also find that allowing farmers to commit to paying the premium just one month later increases demand by 21 percentage points. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering both time and state in insurance and provides insight into how to increase demand, particularly among the poor.","
The provided abstract touches upon two SDGs:

1. SDG 1 - No Poverty: The study highlights that low insurance demand, especially among the poor, can be explained by intertemporal transfer of income. The pay-at-harvest insurance product, which is linked to a contract farming scheme, addresses this issue by allowing the buyer of the crop to offer insurance and deduct the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. This product leads to a significant increase in insurance demand, with a take-up rate of 72% for poorer farmers.

2.

By addressing the issue of low insurance demand, particularly among the poor, the study contributes to the overall goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all.

Overall, the study's focus on addressing financial constraints for the poor and promoting financial protection can also contribute to SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, as it aims to reduce inequality within and among countries by providing access to financial products that can help mitigate the impacts of poverty and promote financial resilience.","
This abstract has relevance to the following SDGs:

1. SDG 1: No poverty - The study's focus on low insurance demand among the poor highlights the importance of addressing poverty in order to increase insurance uptake. By designing a pay-at-harvest insurance product that is more accessible to poorer farmers, the authors are contributing to SDG 1's objective of eradicating poverty in all its forms everywhere.

2. SDG 2: Zero hunger - The study's context is contract farming, which is a method of agriculture that aims to reduce hunger and poverty by providing farmers with a guaranteed market for their crops. By increasing insurance demand among farmers, this study is contributing to SDG 2's objective of achieving zero hunger by reducing the risks and uncertainties associated with crop production.

8. SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth - By increasing insurance demand among farmers, this study is also contributing to SDG 8's objective of promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work for all women and men, particularly in rural areas.

15. SDG 15: Life on land - The study's focus on crop insurance highlights the importance of addressing the risks associated with agricultural production, which is critical for the sustainable management and utilization of terrestrial ecosystems, combating desertification, and halting land degradation in line with SDG 15's objective.

In summary, this study's focus on insurance demand among farmers contributes to SDGs 1, 2, 8, and 15 by addressing issues related to poverty, hunger, economic growth, and sustainable land use.","
The abstract explores the impact of time versus state in insurance, specifically in the context of contract farming in Kenya. It highlights that low insurance demand, particularly among the poor, can be explained by intertemporal transfer of income. The authors propose a pay-at-harvest insurance product, linked to a contract farming scheme, to address this issue. This product leads to a significant increase in insurance demand, with a take-up rate of 72% for poorer farmers. This study's focus on addressing financial constraints for the poor and promoting financial protection can also contribute to SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, by providing access to financial products that can help mitigate the impacts of poverty and promote financial resilience. Additionally, the study contributes to SDG 1 - No Poverty, SDG 2 - Zero Hunger, SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 15 - Life on Land, by addressing issues related to poverty, hunger, economic growth, and sustainable land use.","
Based on the analysis provided, the abstract contributes significantly to SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities by addressing the issue of low insurance demand among poorer farmers. The proposed pay-at-harvest insurance product, linked to a contract farming scheme, leads to a significant increase in insurance demand, particularly among poorer farmers, with a take-up rate of 72%. This product can help mitigate the impacts of poverty and promote financial resilience, contributing to SDG 1 - No Poverty as well. The study also touches upon issues related to SDG 2 - Zero Hunger, SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 15 - Life on Land, as the proposed insurance product can help mitigate the risks associated with farming, promoting sustainable land use practices, and contributing to economic growth by reducing poverty and financial insecurity. However, as the study's primary focus is on addressing financial constraints for the poor and promoting financial protection, SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities is ranked higher in terms of contribution towards the SDGs.

224,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:111097,"Sovereign debt sustainability in advanced economies
We develop a measure of maximum sustainable government debt for advanced economies. How much investors are willing to lend to a country's government depends on how high a primary surplus they expect that government to generate, how fast they expect the country to grow, how volatile they expect that growth to be, and how much debt they expect the government will be able to raise in the future for the purpose of servicing the debt it seeks to raise today. This last observation points to the presence of a borrowing multiplier, which raises a country's borrowing well above what it would be, absent the ability to service maturing debt out of new debt's proceeds. Present debt is sustainable when implied future debt remains bounded. A country's probability of default displays a marked asymmetry around that country's maximum sustainable debt (MSD): it increases slowly below and rapidly above. We calibrate our measure for 23 OECD countries: Korea has the highest MSD at 281% of GDP and Greece the lowest at 89%. The probabilities of default at MSD are very low, from Norway's 0.27% to Korea's 0.81%. Most countries' actual debt-to-GDP ratios in 2010 are below MSD; some countries are above; these are generally the countries that have received some form of financial support in the wake of the financial crisis.",8,"
The abstract presents a method for measuring maximum sustainable government debt in advanced economies. The measure considers the expected primary surplus, growth, and debt-raising ability, as well as the borrowing multiplier. The concept of a borrowing multiplier allows a country to raise more debt than its current ability would suggest. Debt sustainability is determined by the boundedness of implied future debt. The probability of default increases rapidly above a country's maximum sustainable debt, which varies among OECD countries. The authors calibrate the measure for 23 countries, with Korea having the highest maximum sustainable debt of 281% of GDP and Greece having the lowest of 89%. The probabilities of default at maximum sustainable debt are very low, ranging from 0.27% in Norway to 0.81% in Korea. Most countries' actual debt-to-GDP ratios in 2010 were below maximum sustainable debt, while some countries, including those that received financial support during the financial crisis, were above.","
This abstract relates to SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, as sustainable debt management is crucial for economic growth and job creation. Higher debt levels can lead to higher borrowing costs, which can negatively affect economic activity and employment levels. Therefore, it is essential for governments to manage their debt levels sustainably, as outlined in this abstract's method for measuring maximum sustainable government debt. The authors' findings, with Korea having the highest maximum sustainable debt and Greece the lowest, highlight the importance of debt management for economic development, as excessive debt levels can increase the risk of default and negatively impact economic growth and job creation. Therefore, managing debt levels sustainably, as outlined in this method, is crucial for achieving SDG 8.","
SDG 4: This abstract does not directly contribute to SDG 4, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. However, it is important to note that access to quality education can lead to higher economic growth and reduced poverty levels, which in turn could have positive effects on debt sustainability and reduce the likelihood of default. Therefore, there is an indirect correlation between SDG 4 and SDG 16 (below).

SDG 8: The abstract is highly relevant to SDG 8, which aims to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. The presented measure of maximum sustainable government debt is a critical tool for achieving debt sustainability, which is essential for economic growth and employment. The authors' findings demonstrate that Korea has the highest maximum sustainable debt among OECD countries, indicating that its economy is well-positioned to handle high levels of debt. At the same time, Greece's low maximum sustainable debt suggests that it may be at risk of default and potential economic instability. This information can help policymakers make informed decisions regarding debt management and economic development strategies.

SDG 12: While SDG 12 aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, it is also relevant to debt sustainability, as unsustainable debt levels can lead to economic instability and resource depletion. The presented measure of maximum sustainable government debt helps to ensure that debt levels are sustainable, reducing the risk of default and promoting economic stability. By managing debt sustainably, countries can also allocate resources towards sustainable development goals, such as SDG 13 (below) and SDG 15 (below).

SDG 13: While SDG 13 aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts, it is indirectly related to debt sustainability. Countries that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change may be more likely to accumulate unsustainable levels of debt due to the need to adapt to the changing climate and respond to climate-related disasters. The presented measure of maximum sustainable government debt can help policymakers manage debt sustainably while also addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.

SDG 15: While SDG 15 aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and mountains, it is indirectly related","
The presented measure of maximum sustainable government debt is a critical tool for achieving debt sustainability, which is essential for economic growth and employment as outlined in SDG 8. This abstract's findings demonstrate that countries with higher maximum sustainable debt, such as Korea, are better positioned to handle debt levels, while countries with lower maximum sustainable debt, such as Greece, may be at risk of default and potential economic instability. Managing debt sustainably is also crucial for achieving SDG 12, which aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, as unsustainable debt levels can lead to economic instability and resource depletion. Moreover, countries that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, as related to SDG 13, may be more likely to accumulate unsustainable debt levels. By managing debt sustainably, countries can allocate resources towards sustainable development goals, such as SDG 12 and SDG 13, while also addressing economic development strategies outlined in SDG 8. Therefore, debt sustainability is indirectly related to SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and mountains, as countries can allocate resources towards these goals while managing their debt levels sustainably. This measure of maximum sustainable government debt is a critical tool for policymakers in achieving debt sustainability and promoting sustainable development goals.


Overall, the presented method for measuring maximum sustainable government debt is relevant to SDG 8, SDG 12, SDG 13, and SDG 15, as debt sustainability is crucial for achieving sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all, while also ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, combating climate change and its impacts, and protecting, restoring, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, forests, and mountains.","
Based on the abstract and insights provided, we can rank the SDGs according to their contribution to debt sustainability:

1. SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth: Debt sustainability is a crucial component of economic growth and employment, as outlined in SDG 8. The presented measure of maximum sustainable government debt is a critical tool for achieving debt sustainability, which is essential for economic growth and employment. Therefore, SDG 8 has the highest contribution towards debt sustainability.

2. SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production: Managing debt sustainably is also crucial for achieving SDG 12, which aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Unsustainable debt levels can lead to economic instability and resource depletion. Therefore, SDG 12 has a significant contribution towards debt sustainability.

3. SDG 13 - Climate Action: Countries that are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change may be more likely to accumulate unsustainable debt levels. By managing debt sustainably, countries can allocate resources towards climate action and mitigate the risks associated with debt levels.

In this abstract, the core themes and subjects revolve around the impact of new technology on job displacement and the potential for social unrest. The primary topics addressed include technology-induced job losses, rapid job losses, and the impact on a significant portion of the workforce. The methodology or approach used is not explicitly stated, but the abstract suggests a focus on analyzing the relationship between job displacement and social unrest. The key findings or conclusions presented are that rapid job losses affecting a large part of the workforce can lead to a serious risk of social unrest. This underscores the need for policymakers to address job displacement caused by new technology in a proactive and equitable manner to mitigate the potential for social unrest.","
Based on the provided abstract and core themes, it is evident that this research does not directly relate to any of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, there are implications that could impact SDGs related to decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), inequality reduction (SDG 10), and peace and justice strong institutions (SDG 16).

Rapid job losses due to new technology could lead to social unrest, which could negatively impact economic growth and decent work opportunities (SDG 8). Policymakers must take proactive measures to mitigate the potential for social unrest and ensure equitable job displacement solutions. This could include measures such as providing training and support for affected workers to help them transition to new jobs, promoting entrepreneurship and small business development, and implementing policies that promote job creation and economic growth in affected regions.

Furthermore, the potential for social unrest could exacerbate existing inequalities, leading to further inequality reduction challenges (SDG 10). Policymakers must ensure that job displacement solutions are designed to minimize the impact on vulnerable populations, such as women and low-income communities, and promote inclusive economic growth.

Lastly, social unrest could also negatively impact peace and justice strong institutions (SDG 16). Policymakers must ensure that job displacement solutions are implemented in a transparent and accountable manner, with clear measures for addressing any negative impacts on affected communities. This could include measures such as community consultations, compensation for affected workers, and the provision of support for communities affected by job displacement.

In summary, this research has implications for SDGs related to decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), inequality reduction (SDG 10), and peace and justice strong institutions (SDG 16). Policymakers must take a proactive and equitable approach to job displacement caused by new technology, ensuring that affected workers are provided with support and opportunities, and that any negative impacts on communities are addressed in a transparent and accountable manner. This will help to minimize the potential for social unrest and promote sustainable economic growth and job creation.","
SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
The abstract highlights the negative impact of new technology on job displacement, which is closely tied to SDG 8's objective of promoting sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Rapid job losses caused by new technology can result in a lack of economic opportunities, poverty, and social exclusion, undermining SDG 8's aims. This study's findings underscore the need for policymakers to prioritize the creation of new jobs and upskilling programs to enable workers to adapt to new technologies. Additionally, the study's results emphasize the importance of ensuring that economic growth is shared equitably across society, minimizing inequality and social unrest.

The role of the Internet in contemporary violent conflicts is receiving increasing scholarly attention. In this article, I review some of the pioneering studies that investigate how the emergence and penetration of modern communication technology across the world influences violent conflicts. Building on these important findings, I propose four entry points for future research. First, research on the link between the Internet and violent conflict needs to account for the profound changes the Internet has undergone in past decades, as well as the extent to which its nature is becoming increasingly endogenous to local contexts. Second, little is currently known about the effects of communication technology in violent conflict that move beyond initial mobilization. Third, architectural and algorithmic designs of social media platforms heavily influence the possibilities and constraints of human interactions on the Internet, but to date remain understudied. Fourth, further studies are needed to understand how the Internet has changed how violent conflict is communicated and portrayed both online and offline.",9,"
The provided abstract explores the role of the internet in violent conflicts and highlights the need for further research in this area. The article reviews existing studies and identifies four key areas for future investigation. Firstly, it emphasizes the need to account for the rapid evolution of the internet and its localized adaptations. Secondly, there is a lack of understanding regarding the impact of communication technology beyond initial mobilization. Thirdly, the design of social media platforms significantly affects online interactions and requires further study. Lastly, the abstract calls for an analysis of how the internet has altered the communication and portrayal of violent conflict, both online and offline. Overall, the abstract advocates for more research into the nuanced and dynamic relationship between the internet and violent conflicts.","
While the abstract does not explicitly address any of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it does touch upon themes relevant to SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. The role of the internet in violent conflicts has significant implications for peace and justice, as technology can both exacerbate and mitigate conflict. For example, social media can facilitate the spread of misinformation and hate speech, contributing to tensions and violence. However, it can also be used as a tool for communication and negotiation between parties in conflict, promoting peaceful solutions. The proposed research areas identified in the abstract, such as the impact of communication technology beyond initial mobilization and the role of social media platform design, have implications for understanding how the internet can be used to promote or hinder peace and justice in conflict situations. Therefore, it is possible that future research in this area could inform strategies for promoting SDG 16 goals, such as peaceful and inclusive societies and access to justice for all.","
SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) is relevant to this abstract as it highlights the need to account for the rapid evolution of the internet and its localized adaptations. The proliferation and development of the internet can be seen as a key aspect of technological innovation and infrastructure, with the potential to significantly impact conflict and violence. By studying the role of the internet in violent conflicts, researchers can better understand how technological innovation can be harnessed for peaceful purposes, and how it can be utilized to mitigate the negative impacts of violence and conflict.

SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) is also relevant, as the abstract touches on the impact of communication technology on violent conflict beyond initial mobilization. By examining the effects of communication technology on violent conflict, researchers can better understand how to prevent and mitigate conflict, and how to promote sustainable peace. This aligns with SDG 16's objectives of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

Finally, SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) is relevant as the abstract emphasizes the need for further collaboration and research in this area. By calling for more studies into the relationship between the internet and violent conflicts, the abstract underscores the importance of partnerships between academics, policymakers, and practitioners to advance our understanding of this complex issue. This aligns with SDG 17's objectives of strengthening global partnerships, mobilizing resources, and sharing knowledge and technology to achieve the SDGs.

Overall, the abstract's focus on the role of the internet in violent conflicts is highly relevant to SDGs 9, 16, and 17, and underscores the need for further research and collaboration in this area to promote sustainable peace, technological innovation, and global partnerships.","

228,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:152582,"Unintended side effects of the digital transition: European scientists’ messages from a proposition-based expert round table
We present the main messages of a European Expert Round Table (ERT) on the unintended side effects (unseens ) of the digital transition. Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated communalities and relationships among these unseens  and provided suggestions on (i) what the major unseens  are; (ii) how rebound effects of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research; and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary theory and practice processes for developing socially robust orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the “ownership, economic value, use and access of data” and, related to this, algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the human–environment relationship resulted in the following greater picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor, democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor, and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism. Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens  in this field call for special attention, research and management. Related to the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity), the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character of the human being (i.e., humanity). The findings suggest a need for a new field of research, i.e., focusing on sustainable digital societies and environments, in which the identification, analysis, and management of vulnerabilities and unseens  emerging in the sociotechnical digital transition play an important role.",9,"

The current study examines the following questions: (1) the extent to which individual basic human values are linked with attitudes towards immigration; (2) whether symbolic threat by immigration mediates this relation; and (3) whether cultural values moderate the relations between individual values, threat, and attitudes towards immigration. The empirical analysis relies on the 2014/2015 data from the immigration module of the European Social Survey (ESS) for West and East European countries. We find that universalistic individuals expressed lower threat due to immigration and higher support of immigration while conservative individuals displayed the opposite pattern. Symbolic threat mediated the association between values and immigration attitudes, but in most countries the mediation was partial. The associations between values, symbolic threat, and attitudes towards immigration were stronger in countries characterised by higher levels of intellectual and affective autonomy and weaker in countries characterised by higher levels of cultural embeddedness. The findings provide support for the centrality of human values in the formation of threat and attitudes towards immigration.",10,"
This abstract explores the relationship between individual values, symbolic threat, and attitudes towards immigration in Europe. The study aims to investigate (1) the connection between basic human values and attitudes towards immigration, (2) whether symbolic threat mediates this link, and (3) whether cultural values moderate these relationships. Using data from the 2014/2015 immigration module of the European Social Survey in both Western and Eastern European countries, the results demonstrate that universalistic individuals, who prioritize equality and fairness, express lower threat due to immigration and higher support for immigration, while conservative individuals, who prioritize tradition and conformity, show the opposite pattern. Symbolic threat mediates the association between values and immigration attitudes, but the mediation is partial in most countries. The study also found that the connections between values, symbolic threat, and attitudes towards immigration are stronger in countries with higher levels of intellectual and affective autonomy and weaker in countries with higher levels of cultural embeddedness. Overall, this study supports the significance of individual values in shaping threat and attitudes towards immigration and highlights the moderating role of cultural values in these relationships.","
While this abstract does not directly relate to all 17 SDGs, it touches on SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, as it examines the role of individual values in shaping attitudes towards immigration, which can have implications for reducing inequalities. When individuals prioritize equality and fairness (universalistic values), they are more likely to support immigration, which can lead to more inclusive and equitable societies. On the other hand, when individuals prioritize tradition and conformity (conservative values), they may be more likely to perceive immigration as a threat, which could contribute to inequalities. The study also highlights the moderating role of cultural values, suggesting that countries with higher levels of intellectual and affective autonomy may be more receptive to immigration, potentially leading to more inclusive and diverse societies. Therefore, policymakers and community leaders can promote values that prioritize equality and fairness, and work to reduce cultural embeddedness, in order to foster more welcoming and inclusive attitudes towards immigration and contribute to reducing inequalities.

232,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:144206,"Aid fragmentation and effectiveness: what do we really know?
Aid fragmentation is widely recognized as being detrimental to development outcomes. We reinvestigate the impact of fragmentation in the context of growth, bureaucratic policy, and education, focusing on a number of conceptually different indicators of fragmentation, and paying attention to potentially heterogeneous effects across countries, sectors, and channels of influence. Our systematic and detailed reexamination of existing empirical studies shows that this differentiation is crucial. In some sectors—such as primary education—donor concentration or limiting donor numbers appear to be detrimental rather than beneficial for development outcomes. In other areas, we find the expected negative effect, but only when we conceptualize fragmentation as a lack of lead donors (too limited concentration), rather than in terms of donor numbers. In all cases, sufficient initial administrative capacity in recipient countries prevents the negative and reinforces the positive effects of fragmentation. This stresses the importance of questioning the sweeping conclusions drawn by much of the previous literature. Based on what we currently know, generalizing judgments about the effect of aid fragmentation may be misleading.",10,"
The abstract explores the relationship between aid fragmentation and development outcomes in the contexts of economic growth, policy implementation, and education. Through a thorough analysis of existing empirical studies, the authors find that the impact of fragmentation varies by sector and type of indicator used to measure it. While donor concentration and limiting donor numbers have been shown to have detrimental effects on outcomes in some sectors, such as primary education, the authors find that these effects are only negative when fragmentation is conceptualized as a lack of lead donors, rather than in terms of donor numbers. The authors also emphasize the importance of recipient country administrative capacity in mitigating negative effects and reinforcing positive effects of fragmentation. The authors conclude that generalizations about the effect of aid fragmention may be misleading and that sector-specific and context-specific analyses are necessary for accurate understanding.","
The provided abstract touches on the relationship between aid fragmentation and development outcomes, specifically in regards to economic growth, policy implementation, and education. While the abstract does not explicitly reference any of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are implications for several of them.

Firstly, the abstract's focus on economic growth (SDG 1) and education (SDG 4) highlights the importance of these areas for sustainable development. The authors' findings that donor concentration and limiting donor numbers can have detrimental effects on outcomes in these areas underscores the need for careful consideration of aid fragmentation in these contexts.

Secondly, the authors' emphasis on the importance of recipient country administrative capacity (SDG 16) in mitigating negative effects and reinforcing positive effects of aid fragmention suggests that strong institutions are crucial for successful development outcomes. This reinforces the importance of SDG 16 in promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, as well as providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

Lastly, the authors' call for sector-specific and context-specific analyses (SDG 17) highlights the need for partnerships for the goals, as well as strengthening the means of implementation to ensure sustainable development.

SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
The transfer of natural catastrophe risk through reinsurance or securitization has implications for the affordability of insurance premiums, which can impact the uptake of insurance products, particularly in developing countries. The abstract suggests that the costliness of securitization due to excessive information production by traders may make it less attractive than reinsurance, which could impact the affordability of insurance premiums for individuals and businesses in vulnerable regions. This finding has implications for SDG 7, as it highlights the need to ensure that insurance products are affordable and accessible to those who need them most, particularly in the context of natural disasters and climate change.

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
The transfer of natural catastrophe risk through reinsurance or securitization also has implications for economic growth and job creation. The authors note that both reinsurance and securitization provide opportunities for risk transfer intermediaries, such as traders and reinsurers, to generate employment and contribute to economic growth. However, the costliness of securitization due to excessive information production by traders may make it less attractive than reinsurance, which could impact the demand for securitization products and the associated employment opportunities.

We incorporate consumption indivisibilities into the Krugman (1980) model and show that an importer's per capita income becomes a primary determinant of “export zeros”. Households in the rich North (poor South) are willing to pay high (low) prices for consumer goods; hence, unconstrained monopoly pricing generates arbitrage opportunities for internationally traded products. Export zeros arise because some northern firms abstain from exporting to the South, to avoid international arbitrage. Rich countries benefit from a trade liberalization, while poor countries lose. These results hold also under more general preferences with both extensive and intensive consumption margins. We show that a standard calibrated trade model (that ignores arbitrage) generates predictions on relative prices that violate no-arbitrage constraints in many bilateral trade relations.

The provided abstract highlights the importance of consumption indivisibilities in understanding trade between rich and poor countries, specifically with regards to international arbitrage. This concept refers to the practice of purchasing a product in one market and then reselling it in another market at a higher price, taking advantage of price differences.

The authors' study shows that a primary determinant of ""export zeros"" (non-traded goods in the exporting country) is the importer's per capita income. Households in rich Northern countries are willing to pay high prices for consumer goods, creating arbitrage opportunities for internationally traded products. However, some Northern firms choose not to export to poor Southern countries to avoid international arbitrage.

This highlights the importance of considering international arbitrage in understanding trade patterns, particularly between rich and poor countries.

While this abstract does not directly relate to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it does touch on issues related to poverty and inequality (SDG 1 and SDG 10). The study's findings suggest that trade policies that disproportionately benefit rich countries at the expense of poor countries may exacerbate existing inequalities. As such, policymakers may want to consider the implications of international arbitrage on trade and development, with a focus on promoting more equitable and sustainable trade practices.","
SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
The abstract does not directly address SDG 6, as the study's focus is on international trade and consumption indivisibilities. However, trade and economic development can indirectly contribute to SDG 6 by improving access to clean water and sanitation through increased economic opportunities and resources. The authors do not explicitly discuss this connection, but it should be noted that economic development is linked to improvements in water and sanitation infrastructure and services, which can in turn lead to better health outcomes and reduced poverty.

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
The study's findings have implications for SDG 9, as they shed light on the importance of considering consumption indivisibilities and international arbitrage in trade policies. This knowledge can inform infrastructure and investment decisions, particularly in the context of developing countries, where consumption indivisibilities are more prevalent. The study suggests that trade policies that ignore arbitrage may violate no-arbitrage constraints, indicating the need for more nuanced and sophisticated trade policies that take into account consumption indivisibilities and their effects on international trade.

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
The study highlights the role of income levels in determining ""export zeros"" and the potential for international arbitrage to exacerbate economic inequalities between rich and poor countries. As the authors note, rich countries benefit from trade liberalization, while poor countries suffer losses. This finding underscores the need to address income inequalities and consumption indivisibilities in trade policies, in order to promote more equitable and inclusive economic growth. The study suggests that trade policies that ignore arbitrage may disproportionately benefit rich countries, further widening economic inequalities between North and South.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals
The study's interdisciplinary approach, which combines international trade and consumption indivisibilities, highlights the importance of collaborative efforts and partnerships in advancing sustainable development. The authors' findings suggest that trade policies need to consider a range of economic, social, and political factors, including consumption indivisibilities and international arbitrage, in order to promote more sustainable and equitable economic growth. This requires partnerships between policymakers, economists, and other stakeholders, as well as collaboration across different countries and regions.

The provided abstract explores the impact of consumption indivisibilities on trade between rich and poor countries, specifically regarding international arbitrage. The authors find that a primary determinant of ""export zeros"" is the importer's per capita income, as households in rich Northern countries are willing to pay high prices for consumer goods, leading to arbitrage opportunities for internationally traded products. However, some Northern firms choose not to export to poor Southern countries to avoid international arbitrage, resulting in benefits for rich countries and losses for poor countries from trade liberalization. The study suggests that standard trade models that ignore arbitrage may violate no-arbitrage constraints, highlighting the importance of considering arbitrage in trade policies. This has implications for SDG 6, as economic development can lead to improved access to clean water and sanitation, as well as SDG 9, as consumption indivisibilities and international arbitrage should be taken into account when making infrastructure and investment decisions. The study also underscores the need to address income inequalities and consumption indivisibilities in trade policies to promote more equitable and inclusive economic growth, aligning with SDG 10. Collaborative efforts and partnerships between policymakers, economists, and other stakeholders are necessary to advance sustainable development, as the study's insights can inform policy decisions.","
After analyzing the abstract and merged insights, we identify the following SDGs that the study contributes to:

1. SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation: While the study does not explicitly address SDG 6, the authors' findings have implications for access to clean water and sanitation. As economic development increases, consumption patterns and demands change, which can impact the availability and affordability of clean water and sanitation. By considering consumption indivisibilities and international arbitrage in trade policies, policymakers can make more informed decisions that promote sustainable and equitable economic growth, thereby contributing to SDG 6.

2. SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure: The study highlights the importance of taking consumption indivisibilities and international arbitrage into account when making infrastructure and investment decisions. This can inform the design of infrastructure projects that promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth, aligning with SDG 9.

3. SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities: The study's insights underscore the need to address income inequalities and consumption indivisibilities in trade policies. By recognizing that rich Northern countries may be less likely to export to poor Southern countries due to consumption indivisibilities and arbitrage, policymakers can take steps to mitigate these barriers and promote more equitable and inclusive economic growth, aligning with SDG 10.

While the study does not explicitly contribute to other SDGs, its findings can also inform policy decisions related to poverty, gender equality, and sustainable cities and communities, among others. However, we rank the above three SDGs as having the most significant contributions, given their direct and indirect implications for economic development, infrastructure, and income inequality.

Overall, the study's insights can inform policy decisions that promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth, while also contributing to SDG 6, SDG 9, and SDG 10.","

In this paper we present a comparative life cycle assessment of two processes for the industrial production of methansulfonic acid. The conventional multi-step process for the production of methansulfonic acid is based on the reaction of methanol and hydrogen sulfide to form methanthiol which is used to produce dimethyldisulfate. The dimethyldisulfate reacts further with nitric acid to form methanesulfonic acid. A newly developed process presents the possibility to form methanesulfonic acid directly from methane and sulfur trioxide in a single step at mild conditions. Thus this process enables for the first time the production of a high value chemical through direct activation of methane on an industrial scale. The cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment conducted with the ReCiPe Method revealed that this direct process has a total environmental impact that is 3 times lower than that of the conventional process. The differences resulted from lower energy requirements and alternative reactants used in the direct process. The results therefore demonstrate the potential for methane extracted from natural gas as a greener alternative to oil as a chemical feedstock in the medium term.",12,"

Recent scholarship asserts the existence of “luxury goods voting” arguing that voters penalize parties associated with post-material issues or those with long-run payoffs during economic downturns. We test this arguments here using data from four election studies in Denmark and Germany that explicitly ask respondents to rate parties on one particular luxury goods issue: protection of the environment. Voters who perceive the economy as weak indeed punish governing parties more severely when they associate them with environmental policies; conversely, a green reputation when the economy is expanding garners left-wing parties higher vote probabilities. Right-wing governing parties fare similarly, benefitting from those who perceive them as green when the economy is hale, albeit only converging to the vote probabilities awarded from voters who see them as less green when the economy sours.",12,"
The abstract explores the relationship between voters' punitive behavior towards political parties and their stance on environmental policies during economic downturns. It poses the question of whether voters penalize parties associated with post-material issues, such as environmental policies, during economic hardships. The study tests this hypothesis using four election studies from Denmark and Germany, specifically examining voters' perceptions of parties' environmental policies. The findings suggest that voters indeed punish governing parties for their association with environmental policies during economic downturns, while a green reputation benefits left-wing parties during economic expansion. Conversely, right-wing governing parties also benefit from a green reputation during economic prosperity, although this effect converges with voters' perceptions of them as less green during economic crises. In summary, the study examines the impact of economic downturns on voters' punitive behavior towards political parties' environmental policies and reveals that voters are more critical of governing parties' environmental policies during economic crises.","

Research about biodiversity–productivity relationships has focused on herbaceous ecosystems, with results from tree field studies only recently beginning to emerge. Also, the latter are concentrated largely in the temperate zone. Tree species diversity generally is much higher in subtropical and tropical than in temperate or boreal forests, with reasons not fully understood. Niche overlap and thus complementarity in the use of resources that support productivity may be lower in forests than in herbaceous ecosystems, suggesting weaker productivity responses to diversity change in forests. We studied stand basal area, vertical structure, leaf area, and their relationship with tree species richness in a subtropical forest in south-east China. Permanent forest plots of 30 x 30 m were selected to span largely independent gradients in tree species richness and secondary successional age. Plots with higher tree species richness had a higher stand basal area. Also, stand basal area increases over a 4-year census interval were larger at high than at low diversity. These effects translated into increased carbon stocks in aboveground phytomass (estimated using allometric equations). A higher variability in tree height in more diverse plots suggested that these effects were facilitated by denser canopy packing due to architectural complementarity between species. In contrast, leaf area was not or even negatively affected by tree diversity, indicating a decoupling of carbon accumulation from leaf area. Alternatively, the same community leaf area might have assimilated more C per time interval in more than in less diverse plots because of differences in leaf turnover and productivity or because of differences in the display of leaves in vertical and horizontal space. Overall, our study suggests that in species-rich forests niche-based processes support a positive diversity–productivity relationship and that this translates into increased carbon storage in long-lived woody structures. Given the high growth rates of these forests during secondary succession, our results further indicate that a forest management promoting tree diversity after disturbance may accelerate CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere and thus be relevant in a climate-change context.",13,"
The abstract highlights two primary themes: the relationship between tree diversity and carbon storage in a subtropical forest, and the potential implications of these findings for forest management in a climate-change context. The study focuses on stand basal area, vertical structure, leaf area, and their relationship with tree species richness. The abstract reveals that higher tree species richness is associated with larger increases in stand basal area over time, resulting in increased carbon stocks in aboveground phytomass. This effect is facilitated by denser canopy packing due to architectural complementarity between species. In contrast, leaf area is not significantly affected by tree diversity, suggesting a decoupling of carbon accumulation from leaf area. The study suggests that in species-rich forests, niche-based processes support a positive diversity–productivity relationship, which translates into increased carbon storage in long-lived woody structures.

The influence of Arctic vegetation on albedo, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and active layer thickness is a crucial link between boundary layer climate and permafrost in the context of climate change. Shrubs have been observed to lower the albedo as compared to lichen or graminoid-tundra. Despite its importance, the quantification of the effect of shrubification on summer albedo has not been addressed in much detail. We manipulated shrub density and height in an Arctic dwarf birch (Betula nana) shrub canopy to test the effect on shortwave radiative fluxes and on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a proxy for vegetation productivity used in satellite-based studies. Additionally, we parametrised and validated the 3D radiative transfer model DART to simulate the amount of solar radiation reflected and transmitted by an Arctic shrub canopy. We compared results of model runs of different complexities to measured data from North-East Siberia. We achieved comparably good results with simple turbid medium approaches, including both leaf and branch optical property media, and detailed object based model parameterisations. It was important to explicitly parameterise branches as they accounted for up to 71% of the total canopy absorption and thus contributed significantly to soil shading. Increasing leaf biomass resulted in a significant increase of the NDVI, decrease of transmitted photosynthetically active radiation, and repartitioning of the absorption of shortwave radiation by the canopy components. However, experimental and modelling results show that canopy broadband nadir reflectance and albedo are not significantly decreasing with increasing shrub biomass.

Mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) are highly elongate subglacial bedforms associated with ice streaming. However, the link between MSGLs and rapid ice flow is largely qualitative, and there have been few attempts to quantitatively link their formation to ice flow characteristics (e.g. ice velocity, thickness, basal shear stress). We take measurements of MSGLs from a palaeo-ice stream that once occupied Marguerite Trough, Antarctic Peninsula and explore a range of possible correlations with ice dynamics generated from an ensemble of numerical modelling experiments that reproduce the deglaciation of the ice stream. Our results confirm that high mean ice velocities and a weak bed correlate with longer MSGLs. Furthermore, the height of MSGLs are low (2–3 m) where modelled basal shear stress is low, but their height tends to be higher and more variable where basal shear stress is larger. The mean density of MSGLs decreases as ice flux increases. Our analysis further suggests that the length of MSGLs is a function of basal ice velocity and time. Although our data/model correlations confirm the importance of ice velocity in MSGL formation, a significant challenge remains if we are to employ MSGLs as a quantifiable measure of past ice stream velocity.",13,"

Additionally, the authors use a range of numerical modelling experiments and measurements from a palaeo-ice stream to draw their conclusions, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary partnerships and scientific collaboration in addressing climate change (SDG 17). Overall, this research helps to fill knowledge gaps and inform decision-making related to Antarctic ice sheets and their role in global sea level rise, which is relevant to SDG 13.","
SDG 13: Climate Action

The research discussed in the abstract has the potential to contribute to SDG 13 as it sheds light on the dynamics of ice streaming, a process that contributes to sea level rise. By understanding the relationship between MSGLs and ice streaming, this study could help in predicting future ice loss and sea level rise, which is essential for developing effective climate action strategies.

SDG 15: Life on Land

While the study does not directly address SDG 15, it does involve the collection of measurements from a palaeo-ice stream bed, which falls under the Life on Land category of SDG 15. By studying the subglacial environment, this research contributes to our understanding of the natural systems that exist beneath the Antarctic ice sheets, which is essential for preserving and managing natural resources sustainably.

Overall, while the study's primary focus is on understanding the relationship between ice streaming and subglacial bedforms, its potential contribution to climate action and our understanding of natural systems aligns with the broader goals of SDGs 13 and 15. However, the contribution to SDG 15 should be noted as indirect and secondary to the study's main focus.","
The presented research investigates the connection between mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) and ice streaming in Antarctica. By measuring MSGLs from a previous ice stream and correlating their characteristics with ice dynamics produced by numerical modelling experiments, the authors have established that longer MSGLs are linked to higher mean ice velocities and a weaker bed, while the height of MSGLs is lower where basal shear stress is low but tends to be higher and more variable where it is greater. The mean density of MSGLs decreases as ice flux increases. The length of MSGLs appears to be a function of basal ice velocity and time, with longer MSGLs associated with higher velocities. Although the study confirms the role of ice velocity in MSGL formation, further work is necessary to fully employ MSGLs as a measure of past ice stream velocity. This research provides insights into the relationship between ice streaming and subglacial bedforms, which has implications for SDGs 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land). By understanding the dynamics of ice streaming, this study could contribute to predicting future ice loss and sea level rise, as well as preserving and managing natural resources sustainably. Overall, the study's contribution to SDG 15 should be noted as indirect and secondary to the study's primary focus, but its potential contribution to SDGs 13 and 15 aligns with the broader goals of these targets.","
Through its investigation of the relationship between mega-scale glacial lineations (MSGLs) and ice streaming, this abstract contributes to two of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 13 (Climate Action) and 15 (Life on Land).

SDG 13: Climate Action

The research presented in this abstract has implications for SDG 13, as it sheds light on the dynamics of ice streaming, which is a crucial component of glacial retreat and sea level rise. By understanding the factors that contribute to the formation of MSGLs, such as ice velocity and basal shear stress, this study can help predict future ice loss and sea level rise, which is a key aspect of SDG 13's aim to combat climate change and its impacts.

SDG 15: Life on Land

While the study's primary focus is on MSGLs and their relationship to ice streaming, its results also have implications for SDG 15's goal of preserving and managing natural resources sustainably. By understanding the dynamics of ice streaming, this research can contribute to our ability to predict future ice loss and sea level rise, which will in turn aid in the management of coastal resources and the preservation of natural habitats.

The relationship between aid and voting in UN agencies has been well documented in the aid literature. We extend this analysis to the wider field of international negotiations, outside the sphere of formal voting, where decisions are mostly taken by consensus. Is aid used strategically to influence the negotiations in this context, too? Based on a novel dataset on negotiation behavior under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change we assess whether countries obtaining aid react by expressing increased support and/or reduced opposition towards the donor. Applying linear and instrumental variable regressions on a three-dimensional panel dataset with donor-recipient dyads for the period 2002-2013 enables us to distinguish between long-term partnerships and the strategic use of aid for the purpose of the negotiations. We find that aid can indeed buy support in the climate negotiations, but that this opportunity tends to be limited to mitigation and adaptation aid, rather than general aid. We argue that this is due to both greater demand for and greater supply of these specific types of aid, whose allocation is under the direct responsibility of the specialized delegates participating in the negotiations.",13,"

Life-history adaptations to environmental change can be studied retrospectively in organisms that produce dormant propagules using methods of resurrection ecology. Here, we investigated such responses in a planktonic freshwater rotifer, Brachionus calyciflorus. We resurrected 14 clonal lineages from resting eggs extracted from three distinct sediment layers—representing periods of high, medium and low copper pollution—of a previously contaminated lake (Lake Orta, Italy). We exposed the resurrected clones to four copper concentrations over 14 days and recorded population densities at 48 h intervals. If the original populations in Lake Orta had adapted to the changing pollution levels, we expected to find demographic evidence of this adaptation in the resurrected lineages. However, we found high clonal variation in population-growth dynamics, which was more pronounced within than between pollution periods. Moreover, intrinsic population growth rates (r) increased chronologically. As such, the results did not reveal signs of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, we found that lineages from the period of medium copper pollution invested less into sexual reproduction than lineages from the other periods. By using this bio-demographic perspective, our analysis of resurrected rotifers provides insights into the life-history responses of an aquatic invertebrate in an ever-changing environment.",14,"

Understanding the effects of past climatic fluctuations on the distribution and population-size dynamics of cold-adapted species is essential for predicting their responses to ongoing global climate change. In spite of the heterogeneity of cold-adapted species, two main contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain their responses to Late Quaternary glacial cycles, namely, the interglacial contraction versus the interglacial expansion hypotheses. Here, we use the cold-adapted plant Primula farinosa to test two demographic models under each of the two alternative hypotheses and a fifth, null model. We first approximate the time and extent of demographic contractions and expansions during the Late Quaternary by projecting species distribution models across the last 72 ka. We also generate genome-wide sequence data using a Reduced Representation Library approach to reconstruct the spatial structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships of lineages within P. farinosa. Finally, by integrating the results of climatic and genomic analyses in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework, we propose the most likely model for the extent and direction of population-size changes in P. farinosa through the Late Quaternary. Our results support the interglacial expansion of P. farinosa, differing from the prevailing paradigm that the observed distribution of cold-adapted species currently fragmented in high altitude and latitude regions reflects the consequences of postglacial contraction processes.

The abstract presents a study on how cold-adapted plants, specifically Primula farinosa, respond to climatic cycles during the Late Quaternary. The authors aim to understand the effects of past climatic fluctuations on the distribution and population-size dynamics of these species, which is crucial for predicting their responses to ongoing global climate change. Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the responses of cold-adapted species to Late Quaternary glacial cycles: the interglacial contraction hypothesis and the interglacial expansion hypothesis. The authors test these hypotheses using demographic models and a Reduced Representation Library (RRL) approach to reconstruct genome-wide sequence data. The study integrates results from climatic and genomic analyses using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework to propose the most likely model for population-size changes in P. farinosa during the Late Quaternary. The authors' findings support the interglacial expansion hypothesis, which differs from the prevailing paradigm that the current fragmented distribution of cold-adapted species reflects postglacial contraction processes.

Investigating the broad temporal spectrum of range shifts is important for the conservation of biodiversity, since learning how species responded to climate change in the past provides useful insights on how they might react to warming trends in the present and future.

During the last interglacial, the habitat suitability of Berardia was lower than present and a progressive increase was observed from the last glacial maximum until now. In the future, Berardia appears to lose more than 80 % of its range, becoming endangered by 2050. Our results suggest that Berardia probably survived past warmer periods in situ, expanding its distributional range during cooler periods.

BACKGROUND:  The historical orogenesis and associated climatic changes of mountain areas have been suggested to partly account for the occurrence of high levels of biodiversity and endemism. However, their effects on dispersal, differentiation and evolution of many groups of plants are still unknown. In this study, we examined the detailed diversification history of Primula sect. Armerina, and used biogeographic analysis and macro-evolutionary modeling to investigate a series of different questions concerning the evolution of the geographical and ecological distribution of the species in this section. RESULTS:  We sequenced five chloroplast and one nuclear genes for species of Primula sect. Armerina. Neither chloroplast nor nuclear trees support the monophyly of the section. The major incongruences between the two trees occur among closely related species and may be explained by hybridization. Our dating analyses based on the chloroplast dataset suggest that this section began to diverge from its relatives around 3.55 million years ago, largely coinciding with the last major uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Biogeographic analysis supports the origin of the section in the Himalayan Mountains and dispersal from the Himalayas to Northeastern QTP, Western QTP and Hengduan Mountains. Furthermore, evolutionary models of ecological niches show that the two P. fasciculata clades have significantly different climatic niche optima and rates of niche evolution, indicating niche evolution under climatic changes and further providing evidence for explaining their biogeographic patterns. CONCLUSION:  Our results support the hypothesis that geologic and climatic events play important roles in driving biological diversification of organisms in the QTP area. The Pliocene uplift of the QTP and following climatic changes most likely promoted both the inter- and intraspecific divergence of Primula sect. Armerina. This study also illustrates how niche evolution under climatic changes influences biogeographic patterns.",15,"

1. Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) can vary drastically across environments, demonstrating pronounced sex-specific plasticity. In insects, females are usually the larger and more plastic sex. However, the shortage of taxa with male-biased SSD hampers the assessment of whether the greater plasticity in females is driven by selection on size or represents an effect of the female reproductive role. Here, we specifically address the role of sex-specific plasticity of body size in the evolution of SSD reversals to disentangle sex and size effects.
2. We first investigate sex-specific body size plasticity in Sepsis punctum and Sepsis neocynipsea as two independent cases of intraspecific SSD reversals in sepsid flies. In both species, directional variation in SSD between populations is driven by stronger sexual selection on male size. Using controlled laboratory breeding, we find evidence for sex-specific plasticity and increased condition dependence of male size in populations with male-biased SSD, but not of female size in populations with female-biased SSD.
3. To extend the comparative scope, we next estimate sex-specific body size plasticity in eight additional fly species that differ in the direction of SSD under laboratory conditions. In all species with male-biased SSD we find males to be the more plastic sex, while this was only rarely the case in species with female-biased SSD, thus suggesting a more general trend in Diptera.
4. To examine the generality of this pattern in holometabolous insects, we combine our data with data from the literature in a meta-analysis. Again, male body size tends to be more plastic than female size when males are the larger sex, though female size is now also generally more plastic when females are larger.
5. Our findings indicate that primarily selection on size, rather than the reproductive role per se, drives the evolution of sex-specific body size plasticity. However, sepsid flies, and possibly Diptera in general, show a clear sexual asymmetry with greater male than female plasticity related to SSD, likely driven by strong sexual selection on males. Although further research controlling for phylogenetic and ecological confounding effects is needed, our findings are congruent with theory in suggesting that condition dependence plays a pivotal role in the evolution of sexual size dimorphism.",15,"
The abstract presents a study exploring the relationship between sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and body size plasticity in males versus females. The study aims to distinguish whether the greater plasticity observed in females is due to selection on size or the female reproductive role.

The research involves two sepsid fly species with reversed SSD and eight additional fly species. The study found that in all species with male-biased SSD, males had greater body size plasticity than females, while this trend was less common in species with female-biased SSD. This pattern was also observed in a meta-analysis of holometabolous insects, suggesting a sexual asymmetry with greater male than female plasticity related to SSD.

A number of diurnal species have been shown to use directional information from the sun to orientate. The use of the sun in this way has been suggested to occur in either a time-dependent (relying on specific positional information) or a time-compensated manner (a compass that adjusts itself over time with the shifts in the sun’s position). However, some interplay may occur between the two where a species could also use the sun in a time-limited way, whereby animals acquire certain information about the change of position, but do not show full compensational abilities. We tested whether Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) use the sun as an orientation marker to provide information for caching and recovery. This species is a social sciurid that inhabits arid, sparsely vegetated habitats in Southern Africa, where the sun is nearly always visible during the diurnal period. Due to the lack of obvious landmarks, we predicted that they might use positional cues from the sun in the sky as a reference point when caching and recovering food items. We provide evidence that Cape ground squirrels use information from the sun’s position while caching and reuse this information in a time-limited way when recovering these caches.",15,"

Despite extensive evidence that biodiversity promotes plant community productivity, progress towards understanding the mechanistic basis of this effect remains slow, impeding the development of predictive ecological theory and agricultural applications. Here, we analysed non-additive interactions between genetically divergent Arabidopsis accessions in experimental plant communities. By combining methods from ecology and quantitative genetics, we identify a major effect locus at which allelic differences between individuals increase the above-ground productivity of communities. In experiments with near-isogenic lines, we show that this diversity effect acts independently of other genomic regions and can be resolved to a single region representing less than 0.3% of the genome. Using plant–soil feedback experiments, we also demonstrate that allelic diversity causes genotype-specific soil legacy responses in a consecutive growing period, even after the original community has disappeared. Our work thus suggests that positive diversity effects can be linked to single Mendelian factors, and that a range of complex community properties can have a simple cause.

Experiments have shown positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships in small plots with model communities established from species pools typically comprising few dozen species.

Here, we combine species inventories from a large-scale network of 447 1-km2 plots with remotely sensed indices of primary productivity (years 2000–2015).

Population dynamics are the result of an interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic environmental drivers. Predicting the effects of environmental change on wildlife populations therefore requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms through which different environmental drivers interact to generate changes in population size and structure.
    In this study, we disentangled the roles of temperature, food availability and population density in shaping short‐ and long‐term population dynamics of the African striped mouse, a small rodent inhabiting a semidesert with high intra‐ and interannual variation in environmental conditions.
    We parameterized a female‐only stage‐structured matrix population model with vital rates depending on temperature, food availability and population density, using monthly mark–recapture data from 1609 mice trapped over 9 years (2005–2014). We then applied perturbation analyses to determine relative strengths and demographic pathways of these drivers in affecting population dynamics. Furthermore, we used stochastic population projections to gain insights into how three different climate change scenarios might affect size, structure and persistence of this population.
    We identified food availability, acting through reproduction, as the main driver of changes in both short‐ and long‐term population dynamics. This mechanism was mediated by strong density feedbacks, which stabilized the population after high peaks and allowed it to recover from detrimental crashes. Density dependence thus buffered the population against environmental change, and even adverse climate change scenarios were predicted to have little effect on population persistence (extinction risk over 100 years <5%) despite leading to overall lower abundances.
    Explicitly linking environment–demography relationships to population dynamics allowed us to accurately capture past population dynamics. It further enabled establishing the roles and relative importances of extrinsic and intrinsic environmental drivers, and we conclude that doing this is essential when investigating impacts of climate change on wildlife populations.",15,"

Perturbation analyses reveal that food availability, acting through reproduction, is the primary driver of both short- and long-term population dynamics. The study identifies strong density feedbacks that stabilize the population after high peaks and allow it to recover from detrimental crashes, buffering the population against environmental change. Even adverse climate change scenarios are predicted to have little effect on population persistence. Explicitly linking environment-demography relationships to population dynamics allows accurate capture of past population dynamics and helps establish the roles and relative importances of extrinsic and intrinsic environmental drivers. The study concludes that this approach is essential when investigating impacts of climate change on wildlife populations.","
The provided abstract discusses the mechanisms by which environmental drivers shape population dynamics of the African striped mouse, a small rodent living in a semidesert with high environmental variability. By disentangling the roles of temperature, food availability, and population density using a female-only stage-structured matrix population model, the study identifies that food availability, acting through reproduction, is the primary driver of both short- and long-term population dynamics. Strong density feedbacks are found to stabilize the population after high peaks and allow it to recover from detrimental crashes, buffering the population against environmental change. Even adverse climate change scenarios are predicted to have little effect on population persistence. Explicitly linking environment-demography relationships to population dynamics allows accurate capture of past population dynamics and helps establish the roles and relative importances of extrinsic and intrinsic environmental drivers. This approach is essential when investigating impacts of climate change on wildlife populations.

In terms of the SDGs, this study contributes to SDG 15 - Life on Land, as the African striped mouse is a species that inhabits a semidesert ecosystem. By understanding the mechanisms that drive population dynamics, conservation efforts can be implemented to ensure the long-term persistence of this species in the face of environmental change, which is relevant to SDG 13 - Climate Action. The study also highlights the importance of strong density feedbacks in buffering populations against environmental change, which is relevant to SDG 1 - No Poverty and SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, as these mechanisms can help maintain populations at levels that provide economic and social benefits, such as through subsistence hunting or ecotourism. Finally, by accurately capturing past population dynamics and identifying the roles and relative importances of extrinsic and intrinsic environmental drivers, this study contributes to SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals, as it provides a framework for understanding the impacts of environmental change on wildlife populations that can inform conservation and management strategies.","
This abstract is relevant to the following SDGs:

Plastic behavioral adaptation to human activities can result in the enhancement and establishment of distinct behavioral types within a population. Such inter-individual behavioral variations, if unaccounted for, can lead to biases in our understanding of species’ feeding habits, movement pattern, and habitat selection. We tracked the movements of 16 adult brown bears in a small and isolated population in northeast Turkey to i) identify inter-individual behavioral variations associated with the use of a garbage dump and ii) to examine how these variations influenced ranging patterns, movements behavior and habitat selection.
We identified two remarkably distinct behavioral types: bears that regularly visited the dump and remained sedentary year-round, and bears that never visited the dump and migrated 165.7 ± 20.1 km (round-trip mean cumulative distance ± SE) prior to hibernation to search for food. We demonstrated that during migratory trips, bears moved more rapidly and were less selective in habitat choice than during the sedentary phase; during the migration phase forest cover was the only important environmental characteristic. Our results thus reinforce the growing evidence that animals’ use of the landscape largely changes according to movement phase. Our study shows that anthropogenic food resources can influence food habits, which can have cascading effects on movement patterns and hence habitat selection, ultimately resulting in the establishment of distinct behavioral types within a population. Identification and consideration of these behavioral types is thus fundamental for the correct implementation of evidence-based conservation strategies at the population level.",15,"
The abstract highlights two main themes: the influence of anthropogenic food resources on bear behavior and the identification of distinct behavioral types within a brown bear population. The study, which involved tracking 16 adult brown bears in Turkey, aimed to explore inter-individual behavioral variations associated with the use of a garbage dump and the subsequent impact on ranging patterns, movements behavior, and habitat selection. The analysis revealed two distinct behavioral types: sedentary bears that regularly visited the dump, and migratory bears that never visited the dump and migrated long distances to find food before hibernation. The study found that during migratory trips, bears moved more quickly and were less selective in habitat choice, with forest cover being the only important environmental characteristic. The findings reinforce the growing evidence that animals' use of the landscape changes according to movement phase, and suggest that anthropogenic food resources can influence food habits, which, in turn, can have cascading effects on movement patterns and habitat selection, resulting in the establishment of distinct behavioral types within a population. The study emphasizes the importance of identifying and accounting for such behavioral variations when implementing evidence-based conservation strategies at the population level.","
The provided abstract touches upon two themes that are relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Firstly, the study highlights the impact of anthropogenic food resources on bear behavior, which falls under SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. The study demonstrates how the availability of human-generated food sources can lead to the establishment of distinct behavioral types within a brown bear population. This finding emphasizes the need to consider the unintended consequences of human activities, such as the creation of anthropogenic food resources, on wildlife populations and the need to manage these impacts through responsible production and consumption practices.

Secondly, the study explores inter-individual behavioral variations associated with the use of a garbage dump, which is relevant to SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The findings suggest that the availability of human-generated food sources can influence movement patterns and habitat selection, ultimately resulting in the establishment of distinct behavioral types within a population. This highlights the need to consider the impact of urbanization and development on wildlife populations and the need to manage these impacts through sustainable urban planning and conservation strategies.

Overall, the study underscores the importance of understanding the interplay between human activities and wildlife behavior, and the need to consider the unintended consequences of these activities on wildlife populations when implementing conservation strategies at the population level. By identifying and accounting for inter-individual behavioral variations, we can better understand wildlife populations and develop more effective conservation strategies that address the complex interactions between human activities and wildlife behavior.","

Human-related food resources such as garbage dumps and feeding sites have been shown to significantly influence space use, breeding success and population dynamics in a variety of animal species. In contrast, relatively little is known on the effects of unpredictable sources of food, such as carcasses discarded by hunters, on carnivore species. We evaluated the effect of elephant carcasses, mainly deriving from trophy hunting, on the ranging and feeding behavior of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Using data from hyenas monitored before and during carcass availability via GPS radio-collars and camera traps, we investigated changes in ranging and feeding behavior over time. Carcass availability influenced hyenas’ ranging behavior for an average of 10–12 days, after which their movements returned to patterns observed before carcass availability. In particular, we observed an increased spatial clustering of locations and reduced speeds (up to 15% less) between successive locations with carcass availability. Consistent feeding at carcasses during the first two weeks was typical, and some individuals fed from elephant carcasses for as long as 50 days. The impact and conservation value of hunting are often assessed based solely on the effects on the hunted species. Our results show that hunting remains can influence other species and suggest that such extra food could have important effects on critical life history processes and ultimately population dynamics. We recommend conservationists and wildlife managers evaluate management strategies and hunting practices regarding carcass disposal in order to incorporate the potential collateral impacts of hunting on non-hunted species in the same community.",15,"

261,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:97395,"Effects of recent environmental change on accuracy of inferences of extinction status
Correctly classifying a species as extinct or extant is of critical importance if current rates of biodiversity loss are to be accurately quantified. Observing an extinction event is rare, so in many cases extinction status is inferred using methods based on the analysis of records of historic sighting events. The accuracy of such methods is difficult to test. However, results of recent experiments with microcosm communities suggest that the rate at which a population declines to extinction, potentially driven by varying environmental conditions, may alter one's ability accurately to infer extinction status. We tested how the rate of population decline, driven by historic environmental change, alters the accuracy of 6 commonly applied sighting-based methods used to infer extinction. We used data from small-scale experimental communities and recorded wild population extirpations. We assessed how accuracy of the different methods was affected by rate of population decline, search effort, and number of sighting events recorded. Rate of population decline and historic population size of the species affected the accuracy of inferred extinction dates; however, faster declines produced more accurate inferred dates of extinction, but only when population sizes were higher. Optimal linear estimation (OLE) offered the most reliable and robust estimates, though no single method performed best in all situations, and it may be appropriate to use a different method if information regarding historic search efforts is available.

The abstract explores the accuracy of methods used to infer extinction status based on historic sighting events, as accurately determining extinction is crucial for quantifying current rates of biodiversity loss. The study employs results from recent experiments with microcosm communities and wild population extirpations to test how the rate of population decline driven by historic environmental change affects the accuracy of six commonly used methods. The analysis reveals that faster declines produce more accurate inferred dates of extinction, but only for populations with higher historic sizes. Optimal linear estimation (OLE) provided the most reliable and robust estimates, but the choice of method should depend on the availability of historic search efforts information. The study highlights that rate of population decline and historic population size affect the accuracy of inferred extinction dates, and OLE offers the most accurate estimates when the number of sighting events used is greater than 10.

Due to the large carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, dynamics of photosynthesis can have significant effects on atmospheric CO2 concentrations and lead to large uncertainties in ecosystem C budgets. Remote sensing approaches using sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) hold the potential to directly assess ecosystem photosynthesis. However, many challenges remain linked to using the SIF emission signal to estimate gross primary production (GPP). The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of the relationships between GPP and SIF over different time scales (minutes to years) and under varying environmental conditions. Two different ecosystems were investigated, a cropland and a mixed forest, with continuous eddy covariance flux measurements. Continuous tower-based SIF retrievals were performed in 2015 and 2016 at both ecosystems.

In both ecosystems, SIF was found to be more affected by environmental conditions than GPP. Annual cycles for GPP and SIF differed at the mixed forest due in part to the influence of the different footprint size of the two independent measurements. Diurnal cycles in GPP and SIF corresponded well under unstressed conditions and followed the incoming photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). However, depressions in SIF were found at both sites either at midday or in the afternoon during the growing season. At the cropland site, reductions in SIF occurred at high PPFD (PPFD > 1470 μmol m−2 s−1, R2 = 0.62) and high VPD (VPD > 1590 Pa, R2 = 0.35). Whereas at the forest site, reductions in SIF were linked to high VPD (VPD > 1250 Pa, R2 = 0.25), but not to high PPFD (R2 = 0.84). The depression in SIF was also associated with an increase in non-photochemical quenching, as indicated by the photochemical reflectance index (R2 = 0.78), thus showing the complementarity between SIF and non-photochemical quenching as different energy pathways.

Plant resource partitioning is a mechanism promoting species coexistence and ecosystem functioning. Yet, we still have limited understanding of how soil microbes, especially plant symbiotic microbes, influence resource partitioning. We hypothesized that soil‐borne microbes, in particular mycorrhizal fungi, facilitate differential performance of tree species depending on different nitrogen sources and that this leads to a positive plant diversity–community productivity relationship.
    We conducted two complementing glasshouse experiments. In a “monoculture experiment,” we supplied nitrogen as ammonium, nitrate or glycine and tested the growth response of three tree species associated with different root symbionts: one associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi, one associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the third associated with both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and N‐fixing bacteria. In an “intermixed experiment,” we grew the tree species at three richness levels (one, two or three species) in soil supplied with a mix of the three nitrogen forms or no added nitrogen, and with or without soil microbes.
    The monoculture experiment showed that in the presence of soil microbes, the ectomycorrhizal plant species grew best when supplied with glycine and the two arbuscular mycorrhizal plant species grew best with either nitrate or ammonium addition. When the different forms of nitrogen were mixed in the intermixed experiment, plant mixtures produced more biomass than plant monocultures in the presence of soil microbes, with positive complementarity effects indicating microbe‐mediated plant resource partitioning.
    Our results suggest that co‐existing tree species can partition soil nitrogen when grown with their particular mycorrhizal symbionts or other soil microbes, resulting in positive biodiversity effects in complex resource environments.",15,"

In the first, the growth response of three tree species with different root symbionts was tested in soil supplied with three nitrogen forms. The second experiment involved growing the tree species at different richness levels in soil containing a mix of nitrogen sources, with or without soil microbes. The study found that in the presence of soil microbes, each tree species grew best with a specific nitrogen source, resulting in positive complementarity effects and increased biomass production in mixed species compared to monocultures.

Background: The impact of logging and restoration on species diversity has been well studied in tropical forests. However, little is known about their effects on genetic diversity within species.
Aims: We assess the degree of genetic diversity among dipterocarp seedlings used for enrichment planting of selectively logged forests in Sabah, Malaysia, and compare it with diversity in naturally regenerating seedlings.
Methods: We sampled young leaf tissues from seedlings of Shorea leprosula and Parashorea malaanonan for DNA genotyping, using microsatellite markers.
Results: The levels of genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity and rarefied allelic richness) of naturally regenerating seedlings were statistically indistinguishable among unlogged, once logged and repeatedly logged forest areas. Enrichment-planted seedlings of P. malaanonan exhibited similar levels of genetic diversity to naturally regenerating seedlings whereas those of S. leprosula had significantly lower genetic diversity than natural seedlings. Interestingly, reduction of genetic variation was consistently observed in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots among enrichment-planted seedlings.
Conclusions: There was no reduction of genetic variation in naturally regenerating dipterocarp seedlings in areas of selective logging. However, genetic variation of enrichment-planted seedlings was lower in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots. This suggests that enrichment-planting strategies should adopt diverse mixtures that should promote levels of both species richness and genetic diversity within species.",15,"

The study contributes to SDG 13 by providing insights into the impact of logging and restoration on genetic variation, which can inform climate action strategies. The study's findings suggest that enrichment-planting strategies should promote genetic diversity within species to increase the resilience of forests to climate change. This is because genetic variation within species can lead to greater adaptive capacity in response to changing environmental conditions (IPCC, 2019).

SDG 15: Life on Land

The study directly contributes to SDG 15 by examining the genetic diversity of two tropical tree species in Borneo following logging and restoration. The study's findings suggest that there is no reduction of genetic variation in naturally regenerating dipterocarp seedlings in areas of selective logging, which indicates that logging and restoration practices do not necessarily result in a loss of genetic diversity in tropical forests. This is important because it provides evidence that restoration practices can be effective in preserving genetic diversity in tropical forests, which is essential for maintaining the ecological integrity and function of these ecosystems.

SDG 15 - Life on Land: The study's findings highlight the importance of promoting genetic variation within species to enhance the resilience of forests to climate change, which is essential for maintaining the ecological integrity and function of tropical forests. As such, the study contributes significantly to SDG 15.

2. SDG 13 - Climate Action: By examining the genetic variation of two tropical tree species following logging and restoration in Borneo, the study provides insights into how forests can be managed to enhance their resilience to climate change. The study's findings suggest that enrichment-planting strategies should prioritize mixed-species plots to promote genetic variation within species, which could enhance the long-term survival and adaptation of forests to environmental changes.

3. SDG 1: No Poverty and SDG 2: Zero Hunger: Although not explicitly stated, the study's findings could have indirect contributions to these SDGs. The preservation of genetic diversity within species could lead to the development of more resilient and productive tree species, which could have economic benefits for local communities through the production of timber, non-timber forest products, and other ecosystem services.

4. SDG 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The study's findings could also have implications for this SDG. By promoting mixed-species plots and preserving genetic variation within species, the study's findings could contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of tropical forests, which is essential for promoting peace and justice, as forests are often important cultural and spiritual resources for local communities.

5. SDG 4: Quality Education: The study's methodology, which involves genotyping young leaf tissues from seedlings using microsatellite markers, could have educational and training implications for the next generation of forest researchers and managers, as it provides insights into the genetic variation of tropical tree species following logging and restoration.

6. SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure: The study's findings could also have indirect contributions to this SDG. By highlighting the importance of promoting genetic variation within species to enhance the resilience of forests to climate change, the study's findings could contribute to the development of more sustainable forest","

This paper analyzes frontier dynamics of land dispossessions in Ethiopia’s pastoral lowland regions. Through a case study of two sedentarization schemes in South Omo Valley, we illustrate how politics of coercive sedentarization are legitimated in the ‘civilizing’ impetus of ‘improvement schemes’ for ‘backward’ pastoralists. We study sedentarization schemes that are implemented to evict pastoralist communities from grazing land to be appropriated by corporate investors. It is argued that frontier imaginations of pastoral lowlands legitimate coercive practices of ‘emptying’ the lowlands for investments. ‘Improvement schemes’ enroll private investors and enterprises affiliated with Ethiopia’s ruling party in the politics of ‘thickening’ state presence in the pastoral frontier. Agricultural extension packages serve to expand state control over sedentarized pastoralists and make lowland resources more extractable, for investors and for the ruling regime.",16,"
In this abstract, the core themes and subjects revolve around land dispossessions, coercive agrarian development, and the ""civilizing"" impetus of improvement schemes in Ethiopia's pastoral lowland regions. The paper analyzes two sedentarization schemes in the South Omo Valley, illustrating how politics of coercive sedentarization are legitimated in the name of ""civilizing"" backward pastoralists. The schemes aim to evict pastoralist communities from grazing land to make way for corporate investors. The study argues that frontier imaginations of pastoral lowlands justify the ""emptying"" of these areas for investment and the expansion of state control over sedentarized pastoralists. The schemes serve to make lowland resources more extractable for both investors and the ruling regime through agricultural extension packages. The methodology used in this paper is a case study approach, providing a contextual understanding of the terms and concepts mentioned. The key findings and conclusions suggest that coercive agrarian development and the legitimation of coercive practices through frontier imaginations are ongoing issues in Ethiopia's pastoral lowlands, impacting the lives and livelihoods of pastoralist communities.","
This abstract presents insights related to SDGs 1 (No Poverty), 5 (Gender Equality), and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). The paper analyzes land dispossessions and coercive agrarian development in Ethiopia's pastoral lowland regions, which disproportionately affect pastoralist communities, many of whom are women. The paper highlights the legitimation of coercive practices through the ""civilizing"" impetus of improvement schemes, which are implemented to evict pastoralist communities from grazing land and appropriate it for corporate investors. This results in the further impoverishment of pastoralist communities, exacerbating income and wealth inequality (SDG 10). The study also touches upon the expansion of state control over sedentarized pastoralists, which may have implications for SDG 5, as women often bear the brunt of such developments and may face additional forms of disadvantage and exclusion. However, the study does not directly engage with the other SDGs. Therefore, we cannot make a strong case for any of the other SDGs, and must classify this abstract under SDG 0 (No Goal).","
SDG 1: No Poverty
The abstract sheds light on how the implementation of sedentarization schemes in Ethiopia's pastoral lowlands is resulting in the displacement of pastoralist communities, who may then fall into poverty due to the loss of their land and livelihoods. This is in line with SDG 1, which aims to eradicate poverty in all its forms everywhere.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
The abstract highlights the coercive practices involved in the sedentarization schemes, which may be considered a violation of human rights and could potentially lead to social and political unrest. This aligns with SDG 16, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The sedentarization schemes discussed in the abstract have the potential to negatively impact the environment and the land itself, as lowland resources become more extractable for investors. This may have adverse effects on local ecosystems and wildlife, which could potentially lead to the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of the land itself. SDG 15 aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.","

Based on the abstract and merged analysis text, the contributions towards the SDGs are as follows:

1. SDG 1 - No Poverty: The sedentarization schemes discussed in the abstract result in land dispossessions, which disproportionately affect pastoralist communities, many of whom are women. This can lead to further impoverishment and income inequality (SDG 10), as these communities may be left without access to resources and opportunities.

2. SDG 5 - Gender Equality: Women often bear the brunt of sedentarization schemes and may face additional forms of disadvantage and exclusion. This highlights the importance of SDG 5 in ensuring gender equality and empowering all women and girls.

3. SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities: The sedentarization schemes discussed in the abstract exacerbate income and wealth inequality, as pastoralist communities are displaced and corporate investors appropriate their land. This aligns with SDG 10 and underscores the need for measures to reduce inequality within and among countries.

4. SDG 15 - Life on Land: The sedentarization schemes have the potential to negatively impact the environment and the land itself, potentially leading to the loss of biodiversity and land degradation (SDG 15).

5. SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The coercive practices involved in the sedentarization schemes may also be considered a violation of human rights and could potentially lead to social and political unrest. This aligns with SDG 16 and underscores the importance of strong institutions and the rule of law in promoting peace and justice.

6. SDG 5, SDG 10, and SDG 15 are all interconnected, as the displacement of pastoralist communities and the loss of biodiversity can lead to further inequality and poverty, as well as social and political unrest. Therefore, it is essential to consider these SDGs in a holistic and interconnected manner.

This paper studies the regulation of concessions in the global gold mining rush. The liberalization of the gold mining sector has given way to complex forms of regulation where non-state and illegal mining entrepreneurs compete in governing mining extraction. Taking the case of gold mining in Burkina Faso, this paper analyses the conditions and dynamics under which such complex regulation takes place. We draw on extensive ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Northern Burkina Faso, in particular the Burkinabè mining sector. We argue that enclave economies in the gold mining sector are co-produced by state and market regulation through a ‘‘plurification” of regulatory authority. This ‘‘plurification” is the effect of competition among different frontier entrepreneurs, who seek to broker regulatory authority in mining concession sites. We show that concession sites are not discrete extractive enclaves, but are better understood as indiscrete sites that are entangled in local politics and social relations. Rather than thinning social relations, as is often claimed, we observe that enclave economies thicken politics around concessionary regimes, where governmental bodies re-emerge as an arbitrating regulatory force. These findings problematize policy prescriptions to formalize the gold mining sector and draw attention to the role of the state in re/producing frontier entrepreneurs with unequal political rights to claiming concessions.",16,"

Based on the core themes provided, the following SDGs are relevant:

SDG 1 - No Poverty: The paper highlights the competition between state and market actors in regulating concessions, which may impact poverty levels in the region. While the liberalization of the gold mining sector has led to complex forms of regulation, it also presents opportunities for local entrepreneurs to participate in the gold mining rush. The paper does not explicitly address how this affects poverty levels, but it suggests that the 'plurification' of regulatory authority may create unequal political rights to claiming concessions, which could potentially exacerbate poverty.

SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation: The paper does not directly address SDG 6, but it does touch on the local politics and social relations surrounding concession sites. In some cases, gold mining activities may contaminate local water sources, leading to negative health impacts on nearby communities. Therefore, it is possible that this issue could be related to SDG 6, as clean water and sanitation are crucial for preventing diseases and promoting overall health and well-being.

SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production: The paper addresses the need for responsible consumption and production patterns in the gold mining sector. It highlights the complex forms of regulation that arise from competition between state and market actors, suggesting that these regulatory regimes may impact the responsible consumption and production of resources in the area. The paper does not explicitly address how this relates to SDG 12, but it suggests that responsible consumption and production patterns could be influenced by the competition between state and market actors in regulating concessions.

SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The paper touches on the role of the state in re/producing frontier entrepreneurs with unequal political rights to claiming concessions, which could potentially impact peace and justice in the region. The authors argue that concession sites are not isolated, but rather entangled in local politics and social relations, which could potentially lead to conflicts or injustices in the area. Therefore, it is possible that this issue could be related to SDG 16, as it calls for strong institutions to promote peace and justice.

This abstract is relevant to SDGs 1, 16, and 12 as it touches upon issues related to poverty reduction, peace, justice, and strong institutions, and sustainable consumption and production patterns.

SDG 1: No poverty
The abstract addresses poverty reduction in the context of gold mining in Burkina Faso. It highlights the competition between non-state and illegal mining entrepreneurs, who compete in governing mining extraction. The authors argue that such complex regulation takes place due to the 'plurification' of regulatory authority, as frontier entrepreneurs seek to broker this authority. These findings challenge policy prescriptions to formalize the gold mining sector and draw attention to the role of the state in producing frontier entrepreneurs with unequal political rights to claiming concessions.

When do more severe punishments not deter crimes and when are stronger incentives for control personnel ineffective to motive control? This contribution shows when incentives for crime control have paradoxical effects. It follows from game theoretical reasoning that the opposed interests between criminals and inspectors lead to strategies, where both seek to outsmart each other. If both do so, ego's incentives only affect alter's behavior. This ""strategic incentive effect"" implies that higher punishments do not cause less crimes, but less inspections. This was experimentally corroborated by Rauhut (2009). The second implication is that stronger inspection incentives do not cause more inspections, but less crimes. This paper studies the second implication under farsighted strategic actors, shows its robustness by agent-based simulations of backward-looking learning and provides experimental evidence. In the laboratory experiment, 200 subjects were partitioned into ""citizens"" who could steal money from each other and ""inspectors"" who could invest in inspection to detect criminal citizens. Results confirm that stronger inspection incentives cause less crime. However, actors are less strategic than predicted: stronger inspection incentives also cause more inspections. This is discussed by differentiating between the ""strategic incentive-effect"", where ego's incentives only affect alter's behavior and the ""own incentive-effect"", where ego's incentives also affect ego's behavior. Conclusions discuss alternative models of rationality and heuristics and how the presented findings may be used for constructing novel theories on crime and social norms. Also policy implications are discussed.",16,"
The abstract presents a study investigating when stronger incentives for crime control may have paradoxical effects. It suggests that when criminals and inspectors have opposed interests, their strategies can lead to behaviors where both seek to outsmart each other. Higher punishments do not necessarily deter crimes, as they may only affect the behavior of the other party. Additionally, stronger inspection incentives do not necessarily result in more inspections, but may instead lead to less crime. The study provides experimental evidence for this second implication and highlights that actors may be less strategic than predicted, as stronger inspection incentives can also lead to more inspections. The study proposes differentiating between the ""strategic incentive-effect"" and the ""own incentive-effect."" The findings may contribute to the development of novel theories on crime and social norms, and policy implications are discussed.","
This abstract presents a study exploring when stronger incentives for crime control may have unintended consequences. The research suggests that when criminals and inspectors have conflicting interests, their strategies can lead to behaviors where both try to outmaneuver each other. Higher punishments may not deter crimes, as they can only affect the other party's behavior. Furthermore, stronger inspection incentives do not necessarily result in more inspections but may instead lead to fewer crimes. The study provides experimental evidence for this second implication and notes that actors may be less strategic than anticipated, as stronger inspection incentives can also result in more inspections. The study proposes distinguishing between the ""strategic incentive-effect"" and the ""own incentive-effect."" The findings could contribute to the development of new theories on crime and social norms, and policy implications are also discussed.

This research could have implications for several SDGs related to sustainable development. The study's focus on crime control highlights SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. By exploring the paradoxical effects of stronger incentives for crime control, this study could help policymakers design more effective crime prevention strategies that take into account the complex interplay between criminals and inspectors.

Moreover, the study's findings could have implications for SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. By identifying situations where stronger inspection incentives may lead to fewer crimes, this study could help policymakers design more effective crime prevention strategies that promote safer and more sustainable urban environments.

Additionally, the study's focus on strategic actors highlights the importance of considering human behavior and rationality when designing crime prevention strategies. This aligns with SDG 4: Quality Education, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. By understanding how individuals respond to different incentives, policymakers could design more effective education programs that promote social norms and values that discourage criminal behavior.

SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.

The abstract's focus on the strategic behaviors of criminals and inspectors in relation to inspection incentives aligns with SDG 16's objective of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development by addressing the issues of crime and social norms. The study's contribution to SDG 16 is twofold: it sheds light on how stronger inspection incentives can have paradoxical effects and how actors' behaviors can differ from predicted models of rationality. These insights may aid in building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels by informing policy decisions related to crime control and social norms.

SDG 15: Promote the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial, marine and aquatic ecosystems and resources for sustainable development.

At first glance, the abstract's focus on criminal behavior and inspection games may not seem directly related to SDG 15's objective of promoting the conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems and resources for sustainable development. However, criminal behavior often results in ecological damage and resource depletion. Understanding how inspection incentives affect criminal behavior, as investigated in this study, can inform policies related to environmental crime prevention and conservation efforts, which contribute to SDG 15's objective.

Members of conflicting groups are motivated to restore their ingroup's agency, leading to antisocial tendencies against the outgroup. The present research tested the hypothesis that affirming conflicting groups' agency would increase their members' mutual prosociality. The effectiveness of agency affirmation was demonstrated in three contexts of conflict between groups: Switzerland and the EU following the 2014 referendum (Study 1), Israelis and Palestinians (Study 2), and Israeli rightists and leftists (Study 3). Study 1 found that in a nonconflictual context Swiss participants prioritized their moral (prosocial) over agentic goals, yet in the context of conflict with the EU, they prioritized their agentic over moral goals. This “primacy-of-agency” effect, however, was eliminated once their ingroup's agency was affirmed. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated the positive effect of agency affirmation on prosociality among Israelis referring to Palestinians and Israeli rightists and leftists referring to the adversarial political camp. This effect was mediated by group members' readiness to relinquish some power for the sake of morality. Pointing to the importance of the affirmation's specific content, Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that morality affirmation failed to increase prosociality. As such, the present research puts forward a promising strategy to reduce hostility and promote prosociality between conflicting groups.",16,"
The abstract presents a study that investigates the impact of affirming conflicting groups' agency on their mutual prosociality. The research finds that during non-conflictual situations, individuals prioritize prosocial goals over agentic ones. However, in conflictual situations, individuals prioritize agentic goals over prosocial ones. The study shows that affirming conflicting groups' agency eliminates this ""primacy-of-agency"" effect and promotes mutual prosociality. This effect is mediated by the groups' readiness to relinquish power for the sake of morality. The study's findings are demonstrated in three contexts: Switzerland and the EU, Israelis and Palestinians, and Israeli rightists and leftists. The study highlights the importance of the specific content of the affirmation, as morality affirmation alone does not increase prosociality. The research suggests a promising strategy to reduce hostility and promote prosociality between conflicting groups.","
In terms of the Sustainable Development Goals, this study's focus on promoting mutual prosociality between conflicting groups could potentially contribute to SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. By reducing hostility and promoting prosociality, this study could contribute to the goal of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. Moreover, this study's findings could have implications for SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals, as it highlights the importance of affirming conflicting groups' agency as a promising strategy for promoting prosociality and reducing hostility. This study's findings could also contribute to SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, as promoting prosociality and reducing hostility could have positive impacts on mental and physical health.

Specifically, in the context of the Israelis and Palestinians, this study's findings could have implications for SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals, as promoting prosociality and reducing hostility could lead to increased cooperation and partnerships between the two conflicting groups. This study's findings could also have implications for SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, as promoting prosociality and reducing hostility could contribute to the goal of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development.

In terms of the other contexts presented in this study, the findings could potentially contribute to SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions in those contexts as well. By reducing hostility and promoting prosociality, this study could contribute to the goal of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development in those contexts as well.

The study's use of three contexts to test the effectiveness of agency affirmation demonstrates the importance of cross-cultural and multi-disciplinary research in achieving sustainable development. The research's potential to reduce hostility and promote prosociality between conflicting groups could contribute to the strengthening of global partnerships and the promotion of sustainable development goals.

Overall, the study's findings suggest a promising strategy to promote peaceful societies and strengthen global partnerships, contributing to the achievement of SDGs 16 and 17.","
The presented study explores the impact of affirming conflicting groups' agency on promoting mutual prosociality between them. The research reveals that during non-conflictual situations, individuals prioritize prosocial goals over agentic ones. However, in conflictual situations, individuals prioritize agentic goals over prosocial ones. The study demonstrates that affirming conflicting groups' agency eliminates this ""primacy-of-agency"" effect and promotes mutual prosociality. This effect is mediated by the groups' readiness to relinquish power for the sake of morality. The study's findings have implications for SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, as reducing hostility and promoting prosociality can lead to more peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. Additionally, the study's potential to reduce hostility and promote prosociality between conflicting groups could contribute to SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals, as it highlights the importance of affirming conflicting groups' agency as a promising strategy for promoting prosociality and reducing hostility. Overall, the study's findings suggest a promising strategy to promote peaceful societies and strengthen global partnerships, contributing to the achievement of SDGs 16 and 17.","
Based on the study's insights, the following is a ranked list of SDGs that the abstract contributes to:

1. SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: As the study's findings have implications for promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, it contributes significantly to this SDG.

2. SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: The study's findings highlight the importance of affirming conflicting groups' agency as a promising strategy for promoting prosociality and reducing hostility, which could contribute to strengthening global partnerships.

3. SDG 1: No Poverty: While the study does not explicitly address poverty, promoting mutual prosociality and reducing hostility between conflicting groups could potentially contribute to reducing poverty by creating more peaceful and inclusive societies.

4. SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions: The study's findings also have implications for promoting peace, justice, and strong institutions by reducing hostility and promoting prosociality between conflicting groups.

It is essential to note that while the study's findings could potentially contribute to SDG 1: No Poverty, the connection is not direct and is a secondary contribution at best. Therefore, it is ranked lower than the SDGs that have a more direct and significant connection to the study's findings.

It's worth mentioning that the study does not appear to contribute significantly to any other SDGs beyond those mentioned above. However, it's possible that further research could uncover additional contributions to other SDGs.

In summary, the study's findings contribute significantly to SDGs 16 and 17 and could potentially contribute to SDG 1 as well.","

269,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:153012,"Raising money for the state: challenges of taxation in developing countries
No state can exist in the long term without effective taxation. To be able to execute its various roles, the state needs to acquire the capacity to enforce compliance with tax obligations. In developing countries, this task is far from obvious. Taxation is particularly challenging in less formalized economies, since it is difficult for the government to gain information about what taxable transactions actually occurred. One important source of information that governments rely on are paper trails by third parties, which document such transactions. This talk presents evidence from Chile and Ecuador on the power and limitations of such paper trails. It also discusses the challenges that can emerge as countries introduce the use of third-party reported information for tax enforcement. The evidence suggests that despite the (helpful) growth of computer-based monitoring using cross-checks of third-party information, strengthening the traditional enforcement capacity of developing country governments still remains crucial for effective tax collection.",16,"
The abstract ""Raising money for the state: challenges of taxation in developing countries"" highlights the fundamental role of effective taxation for state sustainability and the challenges posed by less formalized economies. The abstract highlights that in developing countries, the difficulty of acquiring information about taxable transactions makes taxation particularly challenging. The government's reliance on third-party reported information, such as paper trails, to document such transactions is emphasized. The study presented in this abstract focuses on Chile and Ecuador, investigating the power and limitations of third-party reported information for tax enforcement. The abstract also discusses the challenges that arise as countries introduce the use of third-party reported information for tax enforcement. The study suggests that while computer-based monitoring using cross-checks of third-party information has helpful growth, strengthening traditional enforcement capacity of developing country governments remains crucial for effective tax collection.","
The abstract ""Raising money for the state: challenges of taxation in developing countries"" touches upon SDGs 1 (No Poverty) and 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Effective taxation is essential for the state to execute its various roles and acquire the capacity to enforce compliance with tax obligations. This is crucial for sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty in developing countries, where less formalized economies pose particular challenges for taxation due to the difficulty of acquiring information about taxable transactions. The study presented in the abstract focuses on Chile and Ecuador, examining the power and limitations of third-party reported information, such as paper trails, for tax enforcement. While computer-based monitoring using cross-checks of third-party information has been helpful, strengthening traditional enforcement capacity of developing country governments remains crucial for effective tax collection. Ultimately, this highlights the importance of investing in traditional enforcement capacity for sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction efforts.","
The abstract ""Raising money for the state: challenges of taxation in developing countries"" touches upon several SDGs, including SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), and SDG 14 (Life Below Water).

SDG 8: Effective taxation is crucial for economic growth and job creation, which are core objectives of SDG 8. The abstract highlights that effective taxation is essential for the state to execute its various roles, such as investing in infrastructure, providing public services, and reducing poverty. By discussing the challenges of taxation in developing countries and presenting evidence from Chile and Ecuador, the abstract contributes to our understanding of how to overcome these challenges and foster economic growth.

SDG 12: Effective taxation can also contribute to responsible consumption and production by promoting more sustainable economic practices. This is because taxation can be used to internalize the external costs of production, such as pollution or waste, which can promote more sustainable production practices. By discussing the role of third-party reported information, such as paper trails, in tax enforcement, the abstract sheds light on how taxation can be used to promote more sustainable economic practices.

SDG 16: Effective taxation requires strong institutions and effective enforcement, which are core objectives of SDG 16. By discussing the challenges of strengthening traditional enforcement capacity in developing countries, the abstract highlights the importance of building strong institutions for effective taxation.

SDG 14: While not immediately apparent, taxation can also contribute to life below water. This is because effective taxation can be used to finance measures to address environmental challenges, such as pollution and degradation of marine ecosystems. By discussing the role of third-party reported information in tax enforcement, the abstract sheds light on how taxation can be used to finance measures to address environmental challenges.

Overall, the abstract presents a critical and objective assessment of the challenges of taxation in developing countries and contributes to our understanding of how to overcome these challenges. By highlighting the role of third-party reported information in tax enforcement, the abstract sheds light on how taxation can be used to promote more sustainable economic practices, build strong institutions, and finance measures to address environmental challenges.
