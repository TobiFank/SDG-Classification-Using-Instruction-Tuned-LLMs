The goal of this article is to assess the optimal choices of a smallholder quinoa farmer in the Puno region of Peru, in terms of his decision if and when to undertake certain investments that are expected to increase quinoa yield and crop resistance to harsh weather conditions, such as frost. We focus on two irreversible options, namely quinoa variety management andWaruWaru. The former alternative considers the option of the farmer to switch from his business-as-usual quinoa variety to one that has different yield and frost resistance characteristics. The latter alternative refers to the implementation of an ancestral cultivation practice that is estimated to offer benefits in terms of yield increase and resistance to harsh climate conditions.
We rely on Real Options Analysis to assess the two types of investment opportunities for the farmer. This approach allows us to determine not only whether the investments should be undertaken or not, but also the optimal timing to do so. We find that one quinoa variety (Kancolla) offers the highest benefits to the farmer and switching to this option should be immediate if investment costs are low; however, as costs increase, the decision to switch quinoa variety is optimally postponed until quinoa price uncertainty is reduced. We find that the Waru Waru option is not worth undertaking unless further evidence related to the increase in the productivity of quinoa is developed. However, at increases in productivity above 20%, the Waru Waru option becomes highly attractive. The article also discusses how quinoa price dynamics, yield sensitivity to frost, and governmental support impact decisions of the smallholder farmer.",2,"
The abstract presents a Real Options Case Study analyzing investment choices for smallholder quinoa farmers in Peru's Puno region. The study aims to assess the optimal decisions regarding two irreversible options: quinoa variety management and WaruWaru, which enhances crop resistance to harsh weather conditions. The Real Options Analysis approach is utilized to determine whether the investments should be undertaken, when to do so, and the best choice between the alternatives. The study finds that switching to the Kancolla quinoa variety offers the highest benefits, with immediate implementation recommended for low investment costs, but delayed implementation is optimal as costs increase due to reduced quinoa price uncertainty. The study also reveals that the Waru Waru option is not worth undertaking unless productivity increases by at least 20%. The impact of quinoa price dynamics, yield sensitivity to frost, and governmental support on smallholder farmers' decisions is discussed. Overall, the study highlights the importance of investment decisions for smallholder quinoa farmers in Peru's Puno region, with a focus on quinoa variety management and WaruWaru.","

Norm violations can be contagious. Previous research analyzed two mechanisms of why knowledge about others’ norm violations triggers its spread: (1) Actors lower their subjective beliefs about the probability or severity of punishment, or (2) they condition their compliance on others’ compliance. While earlier field studies could hardly disentangle both effects, we use a laboratory experiment which eliminates any punishment threat. Subjects (n = 466) can throw a die and are paid according to their reported number. Our design rules out any possibility of personal identification so that subjects can lie about their thrown number and claim inflated payoffs without risking detection. The aggregate distribution of reported payoffs allows the estimation of the extent to which the honesty norm is violated. We compare two treatment conditions in which subjects are informed about lying behavior of others with a control condition without information feedback. Observations from a subsequent die throw reveal that knowledge about liars triggers the spread of lying compared to the control condition. Our results demonstrate the contagiousness of norm violations, where actors imitate norm violations of others under the exclusion of strategic motives.",16,"
This abstract explores the phenomenon of norm violations being contagious, with a focus on understanding the mechanisms behind their spread. The study uses a laboratory experiment to eliminate the possibility of punishment and personal identification, allowing researchers to disentangle two potential effects: actors lowering their beliefs about punishment or conditioning their compliance on others' compliance. The experiment involves subjects rolling a die and reporting their number, with payment based on the reported result. The study finds that in treatment conditions where subjects are informed about lying behavior of others, there is a higher incidence of lying compared to a control condition without information feedback, demonstrating the contagiousness of norm violations. The study's results suggest that actors imitate the norm violations of others, independent of strategic motives.","
This abstract does not directly relate to any specific SDGs. However, the concept of norm violations and their contagiousness could indirectly impact several SDGs. Here are some possible implications:

- SDG 1 (No Poverty): If norm violations are contagious and lead to dishonesty and cheating, it could contribute to poverty by encouraging individuals to engage in unlawful activities, such as tax evasion, fraud, and corruption. This, in turn, could hinder economic growth and development, as resources and opportunities are misused or misallocated.

- SDG 4 (Quality Education): The study's findings suggest that knowledge about norm violations could trigger their spread, potentially perpetuating a cycle of dishonesty and cheating. This could negatively impact the quality of education, as students may learn to prioritize their own gains over academic integrity and the value of honesty.

- SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation): In some contexts, norm violations could lead to environmental degradation and water pollution, as individuals may disregard laws and guidelines related to water use and management. This could, in turn, affect the availability and sustainability of clean water and sanitation.

- SDG 16 (Peace and Justice Strong Institutions): Norm violations could also have wider societal implications, as they could erode the trust and confidence in institutions and governance. This could negatively impact peace and justice, as it could foster a culture of impunity and undermine the rule of law.

Overall, the study's findings underscore the importance of social norms and their role in shaping individual behavior and collective outcomes. It highlights the need to understand the mechanisms behind norm violations and the factors that contribute to their spread, as well as the potential consequences of their perpetuation. These insights could inform policy and interventions aimed at promoting norm compliance, preventing norm violations, and building more just and inclusive societies.","

This suggests that the absence of punishment and personal identification in the study may have weakened the institutional frameworks that typically discourage norm violations. By highlighting the role of institutions in promoting responsible behavior, this study underscores the importance of SDG 16's call for strong institutions and the rule of law.

SDG 15: Life on Land
Although not directly related to SDG 15, the study's findings have indirect implications for this goal as well. The study's results suggest that actors imitate norm violations of others, independent of strategic motives. This behavior can have significant environmental consequences, as it may lead to overexploitation of resources and the depletion of natural capital.

Context High-resolution animal movement data are becoming increasingly available, yet having a multitude of empirical trajectories alone does not allow us to easily predict animal movement. To answer ecological and evolutionary questions at a population level, quantitative estimates of a species’ potential to link patches or populations are of importance.
Objectives We introduce an approach that combines movement-informed simulated trajectories with an environment-informed estimate of the trajectories’ plausibility to derive connectivity. Using the example of bar-headed geese we estimated migratory connectivity at a landscape level throughout the annual cycle in their native range.
Methods We used tracking data of bar-headed geese to develop a multi-state movement model and to estimate temporally explicit habitat suitability within the species’ range. We simulated migratory movements between range fragments, and calculated a measure we called route viability. The results are compared to expectations derived from published literature.
Results Simulated migrations matched empirical trajectories in key characteristics such as stopover duration. The viability of the simulated trajectories was similar to that of the empirical trajectories. We found that, overall, the migratory connectivity was higher within the breeding than in wintering areas, corroborating previous findings for this species.
Conclusions We show how empirical tracking data and environmental information can be fused for meaningful predictions of animal movements throughout the year and even outside the spatial range of the available data. Beyond predicting migratory connectivity, our framework will prove useful for modelling ecological processes facilitated by animal movement, such as seed dispersal or disease ecology.",13,"

The tundra is warming more rapidly than any other biome on Earth, and the potential ramifications are far-reaching because of global feedback effects between vegetation and climate. A better understanding of how environmental factors shape plant structure and function is crucial for predicting the consequences of environmental change for ecosystem functioning. Here we explore the biome-wide relationships between temperature, moisture and seven key plant functional traits both across space and over three decades of warming at 117 tundra locations. Spatial temperature–trait relationships were generally strong but soil moisture had a marked influence on the strength and direction of these relationships, highlighting the potentially important influence of changes in water availability on future trait shifts in tundra plant communities. Community height increased with warming across all sites over the past three decades, but other traits lagged far behind predicted rates of change. Our findings highlight the challenge of using space-for-time substitution to predict the functional consequences of future warming and suggest that functions that are tied closely to plant height will experience the most rapid change. They also reveal the strength with which environmental factors shape biotic communities at the coldest extremes of the planet and will help to improve projections of functional changes in tundra ecosystems with climate warming.",13,"

1. Ciliate assemblages play a significant role in the microbial food web. The effects of environmental temperature on assemblage composition may be influenced by abiotic factors such as seasonality and disturbance, but the effects of temperature on ciliate assemblages found on different substrata have not been explored. Sandy bottoms and submerged rocks harbour dissimilar ciliate assemblages, and it might be expected that their ciliate assemblages will respond differently to temperature.
2. We studied how alpha diversity, beta diversity and total biomass of ciliate protist assemblages found on sandy bottoms and submerged rocks differed in 13 geothermally heated streams in Iceland whose mean temperatures range from 5 to 20 °C. We recorded number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and measured the size of cells in ciliate assemblages from both substrata.
3. Effects of temperature on natural ciliate assemblages were substratum dependent. On rock surfaces, both total ciliate biomass and alpha diversity declined with increasing temperature, and beta diversity increased with increasing temperature difference due to OTU nestedness (assemblages from warm streams being composed chiefly of subsets of the OTUs found in colder streams). In sandy substrata, however, ciliate assemblage composition was independent of temperature.
4. Substratum-specific responses may be due to differences in mechanical disturbance, nutrient availability or exposure to invertebrate grazers. Rock-surface assemblages may be more exposed to the flow and retain less nutrient than those of sandy substratum; thus, they may be more strongly resource limited and more responsive to direct effects of temperature on metabolism. Alternatively, rock-surface assemblages may be more exposed to grazing by invertebrates, which intensifies with temperature.
5. Our study highlights the need to account for environmental context such as substratum type to fully understand the effect of temperature on microbial assemblages in streams. Future increases in global temperatures may affect fresh waters differently depending on their prevalent substratum. Those dominated by hard substrata may have their ciliate assemblages, and thus, food-web structures and ecosystem functioning more strongly affected by warming relative to systems dominated by soft substrata.",14,"

8,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:135113,"The risk of female genital cutting in Europe: Comparing immigrant attitudes toward uncut girls with attitudes in a practicing country
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million girls and women have been subjected to female genital cutting. Female genital cutting is defined as an intentional injury to the female genitalia without medical justification. The practice occurs in at least 29 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In addition, globalization and migration have brought immigrants from countries where cutting is commonly practiced to countries where cutting is not traditionally practiced and may even be illegal. In countries receiving immigrants, governments and development agencies would like to know if girls with parents who immigrated from practicing countries are at risk of being cut. Risk assessments, for example, could help governments identify the need for programs promoting the abandonment of cutting among immigrants. Extrapolating from the prevalence and incidence rates in practicing countries, however, is generally not sufficient to guarantee a valid estimate of risk in immigrant populations. In particular, immigrants might differ from their counterparts in the country of origin in terms of attitudes toward female genital cutting. Attitudes can differ because migrants represent a special sample of people from the country of origin or because immigrants acculturate after arriving in a new country. To examine these possibilities, we used a fully anonymous, computerized task to elicit implicit attitudes toward female genital cutting among Sudanese immigrants living in Switzerland and Sudanese people in Sudan. Results show that Sudanese immigrants in Switzerland were significantly more positive about uncut girls than Sudanese in Sudan, and that selective migration out of Sudan likely contributed substantially to this difference. We conclude by suggesting how our method could potentially be coupled with recent efforts to refine extrapolation methods for estimating cutting risk among immigrant populations. More broadly, our results highlight the need to better understand how heterogeneous attitudes can affect the risk of cutting among immigrant communities and in countries of origin.",5,"

The negative impact of motorized private mobility on the environment can be decreased successfully by encouraging more people to carpool. From a psychological perspective, only little is known about the determinants of carpooling. Therefore, this study investigated carpooling behavior based on a theoretical background that integrates (1) the theory of planned behavior, (2) the norm activation model, and (3) dispositional trust. Additionally, we studied carpooling from two separate perspectives: Passengers sharing rides, and the drivers offering rides. We conducted a survey with a representative sample of 342 participants in Switzerland. The results showed that for both, passengers and drivers, normative aspects such as descriptive and personal norms, in combination with perceived behavioral control predicted carpooling intention. Attitude toward carpooling behavior, however, did not have any predictive power regarding carpooling intention, neither for passengers nor drivers. Dispositional trust displayed an indirect effect on intention to carpool as a passenger or driver via perceived behavioral control. Based on these results, we discuss practical implications for designing measures to promote carpooling successfully in the future.",11,"

Specifically, the abstract suggests that conflating commercial and non-commercial research may promote global injustice rather than mitigate it, which could result in backlash against the Protocol in the Global South. The author's methodological approach involves critically analyzing the potential implications of the Protocol's application in different contexts. The key findings of the abstract suggest that policymakers must consider the nuances of the contexts in which the Protocol is applied, recognizing that commercial and non-commercial research require different regulatory frameworks to promote global justice. Overall, the abstract calls for a more context-specific approach to the Protocol to mitigate unintended consequences and promote global justice.","
The provided abstract discusses the potential negative impacts of the Nagoya Protocol, a regulatory framework aimed at addressing global inequalities in the use of genetic resources. While the Protocol applies to both commercial and non-commercial research, the abstract suggests that conflating the two could result in unintended consequences, particularly in collaboration between the Global North and biodiverse countries in the Global South. This could lead to backlash against the Protocol in the Global South and promote global injustice instead of mitigating it. 

This abstract highlights the importance of context-specific approaches in applying the Protocol. While the Protocol is intended to promote global justice, the author argues that commercial and non-commercial research require different regulatory frameworks to achieve this goal. Policymakers must consider the nuances of the contexts in which the Protocol is applied to mitigate unintended consequences.

This abstract relates to several SDGs, particularly SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities, as the Protocol aims to reduce inequalities in the use of genetic resources. SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals, which emphasizes the importance of global partnerships for sustainable development, is also relevant as the Protocol promotes collaboration between the Global North and biodiverse countries in the Global South. However, the author's findings suggest that a more context-specific approach to the Protocol is necessary to ensure that it promotes global justice and reduces inequalities, rather than exacerbating them.

In conclusion, the abstract underscores the need for a nuanced and context-specific approach to the Nagoya Protocol to ensure that it promotes global justice and reduces inequalities, rather than exacerbating them. Policymakers must consider the differences between commercial and non-commercial research to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks that promote global justice and reduce inequalities. By adopting a context-specific approach to the Protocol, policymakers can ensure that it contributes to SDGs 10 and 17, while avoiding the unintended consequences highlighted in the abstract.","
SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
The abstract does not directly address SDG 3, as the Nagoya Protocol's focus is on the regulation of genetic resources, rather than health and well-being. However, the Protocol's implications for research collaboration could potentially affect the development of new medicines and treatments, which could indirectly contribute to better health and well-being in the long run.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The Nagoya Protocol's main objective is to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, which includes those derived from plant and animal species. Therefore, the Protocol's application is directly relevant to SDG 15, which aims to conserve and restore terrestrial ecosystems, halt deforestation, and combat desertification and land degradation. By ensuring that the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources are fairly shared, the Protocol could potentially incentivize the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and promote sustainable land use practices, which would contribute to the achievement of SDG 15.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
The Nagoya Protocol's focus on the regulation of genetic resources also relates to SDG 12, as it aims to ensure that the use of genetic resources is sustainable and responsible. The Protocol's application could potentially encourage the development of more sustainable and eco-friendly products, as well as promote the reduction of waste and pollution.

Aims Plant diversity has been linked to both increasing and decreasing levels of arthropod herbivore damage in different plant communities. So far, these links have mainly been studied in grasslands or in artificial tree plantations with low species richness. Furthermore, most studies provide results from newly established experimental plant communities where trophic links are not fully established or from stands of tree saplings that have not yet developed a canopy. Here, we test how tree diversity in a species-rich subtropical forest in China with fully developed tree canopy affects levels of herbivore damage caused by different arthropod feeding guilds. Methods We established 27 plots of 30×30 m area. The plots were selected randomly but with the constraint that they had to span a large range of tree diversity as required for comparative studies in contrast to sample surveys. We recorded herbivore damage caused by arthropod feeding guilds (leaf chewers, leaf skeletonizers and sap feeders) on canopy leaves of all major tree species. Important Findings Levels of herbivore damage increased with tree species richness and tree phylogenetic diversity. These effects were most pronounced for damage caused by leaf chewers. Although the two diversity measures were highly correlated, we additionally found a significant interaction between them, whereby species richness increased herbivory mostly at low levels of phylogenetic diversity. Tree species with the lowest proportion of canopy leaf biomass in a plot tended to suffer the highest levels of herbivore damage, which is in contrast to expectations based on the resource concentration hypothesis. Our results are in agreement with expectations of the dietary mixing hypothesis where generalist herbivores with a broad spectrum of food plants benefit from increased resource diversity in tree species-rich forest patches.",15,"
The abstract presents a study on the relationship between tree diversity and herbivore damage in a subtropical forest canopy. The main themes and subjects addressed include:

1. Links between plant diversity and herbivore damage: The study explores how tree species richness and phylogenetic diversity affect levels of herbivore damage caused by different feeding guilds in a subtropical forest canopy.

2. Methodology: The study involves establishing 27 plots of 30x30m area in a species-rich forest in China, with a large range of tree diversity. Canopy leaves of all major tree species in the plots are recorded for herbivore damage caused by leaf chewers, leaf skeletonizers, and sap feeders.

3. Key findings: The study reveals that tree species richness and phylogenetic diversity both increase levels of herbivore damage, with the effects being most pronounced for damage caused by leaf chewers. The interaction between tree species richness and phylogenetic diversity is significant, with species richness increasing herbivory mostly at low levels of phylogenetic diversity. Trees with the lowest proportion of canopy leaf biomass in a plot tend to suffer the highest levels of herbivore damage, which goes against the expectations based on the resource concentration hypothesis.

4. Relevance: The results are in line with expectations of the dietary mixing hypothesis, which proposes that generalist herbivores with a broad spectrum of food plants benefit from increased resource diversity in tree species-rich forest patches. The study's focus on a fully developed forest canopy and a range of tree diversity levels provides insights that go beyond previous studies in grasslands and newly established experimental plant communities.","
The provided abstract touches upon SDG 15, specifically target SDG 15.1 and SDG 15.2, which aim to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. The study's focus on a species-rich subtropical forest in China with fully developed tree canopy provides insights into the effects of tree species richness and phylogenetic diversity on herbivore damage caused by different feeding guilds. The study reveals that tree species richness and phylogenetic diversity both increase levels of herbivore damage, with the effects being most pronounced for damage caused by leaf chewers. The interaction between tree species richness and phylogenetic diversity is significant, where species richness increases herbivory mostly at low levels of phylogenetic diversity. Trees with the lowest proportion of canopy leaf biomass in a plot tend to suffer the highest levels of herbivore damage, which goes against the expectations based on the resource concentration hypothesis. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how tree species richness and phylogenetic diversity affect herbivore damage and may inform forest management practices that promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems while mitigating biodiversity loss.","
SDG 13: Climate Action

The abstract does not directly address SDG 13: Climate Action. While climate change can lead to increased herbivore damage in forests (Chen et al., 2019), this study focuses on the relationship between tree diversity and herbivore damage in a subtropical forest canopy, without specifically examining the impact of climate change. Therefore, the study's relevance to SDG 13 is minimal.

SDG 14: Life Below Water

The abstract does not directly address SDG 14: Life Below Water. While forests are important for protecting freshwater resources and regulating water cycles (FAO, 2021), this study does not specifically investigate the role of forest canopy herbivores in these processes. Therefore, the study's relevance to SDG 14 is limited.

SDG 15: Life on Land

The study's focus on the relationship between tree diversity and herbivore damage in a subtropical forest canopy is directly relevant to SDG 15: Life on Land, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, especially forests. This study's results could help inform forest management strategies to mitigate the negative effects of herbivores on tree health and growth, ultimately contributing to the sustainable management of forests.

In summary, while the study's relevance to SDG 15: Life on Land is clear, its relevance to SDGs 13 and 14: Climate Action and Life Below Water, respectively, is minimal.

For many polar organic micropollutants, biotransformation by activated sludge microorganisms is a major removal process during wastewater treatment. However, our current understanding of how wastewater treatment operations influence microbial communities and their micropollutant biotransformation potential is limited, leaving major parts of observed variability in biotransformation rates across treatment facilities unexplained. Here, we present biotransformation rate constants for 42 micropollutants belonging to different chemical classes along a gradient of solids retention time (SRT). The geometric mean of biomass-normalized first-order rate constants shows a clear increase between 3 and 15 d SRT by 160% and 87%, respectively, in two experiments. However, individual micropollutants show a variety of trends. Rate constants of oxidative biotransformation reactions mostly increased with SRT. Yet, nitrifying activity could be excluded as primary driver. For substances undergoing other than oxidative reactions, i.e., mostly substitution-type reactions, more diverse dependencies on SRT were observed. Most remarkably, characteristic trends were observed for groups of substances undergoing similar types of initial transformation reaction, suggesting that shared enzymes or enzyme systems that are conjointly regulated catalyze biotransformation reactions within such groups. These findings open up opportunities for correlating rate constants with measures of enzyme abundance such as genes or gene products, which in turn should help to identify enzymes associated with the respective biotransformation reactions.",15,"

In terms of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this study contributes to SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, as it focuses on the biotransformation of micropollutants during wastewater treatment. Reducing the concentration of micropollutants in wastewater can improve water quality and contribute to SDG 6. The study's findings that biotransformation rate constants increase with solids retention time (SRT) suggest that longer retention times may be beneficial for micropollutant removal, which could inform wastewater treatment plant design and operation to achieve SDG 6 targets. Additionally, the study's identification of shared enzymes or enzyme systems for groups of substances undergoing similar initial transformation reactions could provide insights into the underlying biochemical mechanisms of micropollutant biotransformation and inform strategies for enhancing biotransformation efficiency, which could contribute to SDG 6.

Furthermore, this study contributes to SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, as it highlights the potential for microbial communities in activated sludge to biotransform micropollutants during wastewater treatment. This finding could inform efforts to minimize the release of micropollutants into the environment, as it suggests that activated sludge microorganisms may have the potential to transform these pollutants into less toxic or more easily biodegradable forms. This could contribute to SDG 12 targets, as it could reduce the environmental impact of micropollutant discharge from wastewater treatment plants and promote more sustainable production and consumption patterns.

Finally, this study's findings that different micropollutants display varying trends in biotransformation rate constants could inform strategies for targeted micropollutant removal during wastewater treatment. By identifying the biotransformation potential of specific micropollutants, wastewater treatment plant operators could design treatment processes to optimize micropollutant removal, which could contribute to SDG 6 and SDG 12 targets.

Overall, this study's contribution to SDG 6 and SDG 12 highlights its relevance to sustainable development and underscores the importance of research aimed at improving wastewater treatment processes to achieve more sustainable production and consumption patterns.","

Our analyses demonstrate that the sensitivity of shrub growth to climate was: (1) heterogeneous, with European sites showing greater summer temperature sensitivity than North American sites, and (2) higher at sites with greater soil moisture and for taller shrubs (for example, alders and willows) growing at their northern or upper elevational range edges. Across latitude, climate sensitivity of growth was greatest at the boundary between the Low and High Arctic, where permafrost is thawing and most of the global permafrost soil carbon pool is stored.

While the digital inequality literature has considered differences in the online experiences of many population segments, relatively little work has examined how people with disabilities (PWD) have incorporated digital media into their lives. Based on a national survey of American adults, this paper explores this question through considering both barriers to Internet use and the possibilities the Internet offers PWD. Findings indicate barriers for many PWD to accessing the Internet. Those with five of six types of disabilities measured are considerably less likely to be online than those who are not disabled. People who are deaf or hearing impaired to do not lag in Internet access once we account for demographics, Web use skills, and Internet experiences. However, the study also finds evidence that once online, PWD engage in a range of uses of the Internet as much as people without disability.

The abstract ""Unrealized Potential: Exploring the Digital Disability Divide"" highlights the lack of research on how individuals with disabilities (PWD) utilize digital media. Based on a national survey, the study explores both the barriers preventing PWD from accessing the internet and the opportunities it offers them. The findings indicate that PWD with five out of six types of disabilities are less likely to be online than their non-disabled counterparts, but this disparity diminishes when factoring in demographics, web usage skills, and internet experiences. Interestingly, deaf or hearing-impaired individuals do not lag behind in internet access. Once online, PWD engage in a range of internet uses as much as those without disabilities. The study suggests that PWD take distinct interest in certain online activities, such as sharing their own content and reviewing products and services, pointing to the potential of the internet for this group. The study concludes that moving more PWD online could lead to significant gains for them. 

Methodology: The study is based on a national survey of American adults. The paper considers both barriers to internet use and the opportunities it offers PWD.

Findings: The study finds that many PWD face barriers to accessing the internet, but this gap lessens after controlling for demographics, web usage skills, and internet experiences. Deaf or hearing-impaired individuals do not lag behind in internet access. PWD engage in a range of internet uses as much as non-disabled individuals, and they take distinct interest in sharing their own content and reviewing products and services online.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of the internet for PWD and suggests that increasing their online presence could lead to significant gains for this group. The study indicates that the digital divide among PWD is not insurmountable and that addressing barriers could lead to greater internet accessibility for this population. The paper suggests that PWD's distinct interest in online content creation and product reviewing may signify unique ways they utilize the internet to adapt and respond to society's inaccessibility.","

Agroforestry systems are known to provide ecosystem services which differ in quantity and quality from conventional agricultural practices and could enhance rural landscapes.

Seven ecosystem service indicators (two provisioning and five regulating services) were mapped, modelled and assessed. Clear variations in amount and provision of ecosystem services were found between different types of agroforestry systems. Nonetheless regulating ecosystems services were improved in all agroforestry landscapes, with reduced nitrate losses, higher carbon sequestration, reduced soil losses, higher functional biodiversity focussed on pollination and greater habitat diversity reflected in a high proportion of semi-natural habitats. The results for provisioning services were inconsistent. While the annual biomass yield and the groundwater recharge rate tended to be higher in agricultural landscapes without agroforestry systems, the total biomass stock was reduced. These broad relationships were observed within and across the case study regions regardless of the agroforestry type or biogeographical region.

SDG 15: Life on Land

The abstract's focus on agroforestry systems and their contribution to ecosystem services at the landscape scale is directly related to SDG 15: Life on Land. Agroforestry systems are an agricultural practice that combines trees, shrubs, and crops or animals, which has been shown to improve soil fertility, provide habitat for wildlife, and mitigate climate change (FAO, 2021). The abstract highlights the role of agroforestry systems in enhancing landscape structure, which includes the provision of regulating ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, reduced nitrate losses, and reduced soil losses. These services contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as well as the promotion of forest landscapes and restoration of degraded lands (SDG 15.2 and 15.3). The study's results also suggest that agroforestry systems can provide functional biodiversity, particularly for pollination, and habitat diversity, which aligns with the goal of halting the loss of all types of forests, restoring degraded lands, and promoting sustainable forest management (SDG 15.1 and 15.2). Therefore, the study's findings demonstrate the potential contribution of agroforestry systems to achieving SDG 15 and its associated targets.

While postneoliberalism is often interpreted as a societal reaction against the deleterious effects of marketization in Latin America, this paper develops a finer-grained Polanyian institutional analysis to gain better analytical purchase on the ambivalent outcomes of postneoliberal reforms. Drawing on recent insights in economic geography, and in dialogue with the Latin American structuralist tradition, we elaborate our framework through a case study of the Argentinian soy boom of the 2000s, identifying forms of market extension, redistribution, reciprocity and householding that facilitated this process. We argue for a multi-scalar approach that balances attention to national and extra-local dynamics shaping the combination of these forms, identified through the lens of the “fictitious commodities” of the soy boom: money (credit, currency and cross-border capital flows), land (in the agricultural heartland and frontier regions), labor (transformed and excluded in a “farming without farmers” model) and, we add, knowledge (biotech). Our analysis identifies internal tensions as well as overt resistance and “overflow” that ultimately led to the collapse of postneoliberal regulation of the soy complex, ushering in a wider, market radical counter-movement. Refracting double-movementtype dynamics through the prism of heterodox institutional forms, we argue, allows for a better grasp of processes that underlie institutional recalibrations of progressive and regressive kinds.",8,"

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
The study's focus on forms of market extension, redistribution, and householding sheds light on the effects of economic growth on decent work. The case study of the Argentinian soy boom highlights both progressive and regressive outcomes. On the one hand, market extension led to job creation and increased employment in the soy sector. On the other hand, the ""farming without farmers"" model resulted in the transformation and exclusion of labor, undermining decent work. This analysis underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the impacts of economic growth on decent work and the importance of addressing the tensions between progressive and regressive outcomes.

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
The study's identification of forms of redistribution as a key driver of the soy boom highlights the role of policy interventions in addressing inequality. The analysis reveals that postneoliberal reforms facilitated redistribution, but this process was not without tension. The study identifies overt resistance to postneoliberal regulation and a wider, market radical counter-movement that ultimately led to its collapse. This analysis underscores the importance of addressing the internal tensions and external resistance that can undermine efforts to reduce inequality through redistributive policies.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
The study's emphasis on forms of householding and knowledge (biotech) sheds light on the role of institutions in addressing inequality and promoting peace and justice. The analysis reveals that the collapse of postneoliberal regulation was accompanied by a wider, market radical counter-movement that undermined peace and justice. This analysis underscores the importance of addressing the institutional recalibrations that underlie both progressive and regressive outcomes and the need for strong institutions that promote peace, justice, and redistribution.

From these objectives wederive two normative requirements for capital adequacy tests, called surplus and numeraire invariance, respectively. We characterize capital adequacy tests that satisfy surplus and numeraire invariance, establish  anintimate link between these requirements, and highlight aninherent tension  between the ability to meet them and the desire to give credit for diversification.",10,"
The provided abstract outlines the objectives and normative requirements for capital adequacy tests in financial institution regulation. The two fundamental objectives are protecting liability holders and ensuring the stability of the financial system. The first objective leads to a requirement called surplus invariance, which ensures that a financial institution's capital level remains above a certain threshold even in the face of unexpected losses. The second objective, called numeraire invariance, requires that the capital requirement be independent of the unit of measurement, as this promotes regulatory arbitrage. The paper explores the relationship between these requirements and highlights a tension between meeting them and allowing for credit for diversification, as satisfying both requirements may be challenging. Overall, the abstract emphasizes the importance of aligning capital adequacy tests with the objectives of protecting liability holders and ensuring financial system stability, while also addressing the issues of diversification and regulatory arbitrage.","
Based on the provided abstract and core themes, the following SDGs may be impacted:

SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth: The objectives of protecting liability holders and ensuring financial system stability contribute to the promotion of sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth and full and productive employment and decent work for all (SDG 8). By ensuring the financial system's stability, the paper suggests that capital adequacy tests can contribute to economic growth and employment, as it reduces the risk of financial crises and promotes financial stability.

SDG 16 - Peace and Justice Strong Institutions: The normative requirements for capital adequacy tests, such as surplus and numeraire invariance, highlight the importance of strong institutional frameworks in financial regulation. These requirements promote regulatory consistency and reduce regulatory arbitrage, which contributes to peace and justice by ensuring a level playing field for financial institutions.

SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: The paper's exploration of the relationship between surplus and numeraire invariance and the ability to give credit for diversification highlights the need for partnerships in financial regulation. The paper suggests that meeting both requirements may be challenging, and as such, collaboration and partnerships between regulators, financial institutions, and other stakeholders can help find solutions that balance the objectives of protecting liability holders and ensuring financial system stability with the need to allow for credit for diversification.

However, it should be noted that the paper does not explicitly mention any of the other SDGs. Therefore, SDG 0 - No Goal, may be chosen. Nonetheless, it is worth considering that capital adequacy tests can also contribute to other SDGs, such as SDG 1 - No Poverty, by reducing the risk of financial crises, which can have negative economic and social impacts, and SDG 4 - Quality Education, by promoting financial literacy and education on financial risks and management. However, these impacts are not explicitly mentioned in the abstract.","
SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

We present an agent-based model of wood markets. The model covers softwood and hardwood markets for sawlogs, energy wood, and industrial wood. Our study region is a mountainous area in Switzerland that is close to the border, and therefore partially depends on the wood markets of the adjacent countries. The wood markets in this study region are characterized by many small-scale wood suppliers, and a mix of private and publicowned forests. The model was developed to investigate the availability of wood in the study region under different market conditions. We defined several scenarios that are relevant to policy makers and analyzed them with a focus on the two most important assortments of wood in the study region, namely, sawlogs softwood and energy wood softwood. The development of the prices and amounts sold in the scenarios are compared to a business-as-usual scenario. The scenarios were designed to investigate i) the influence of intermediaries, ii) the influence of the profit-orientation of forest owners, iii) the influence of the exchange rate, and iv) the consequences of set-asides in the study region. The presented model has a large potential to support the planning of policy measures as it allows capturing emergent phenomena, and thereby facilitates identifying potential consequences of policy measures planned prior to their implementation. This was demonstrated by discussing the scenario findings with respect to Switzerland's forestry policy objective of increasing the harvested amount of wood to the sustainable potential. We showed that a higher profit-orientation of forest owners would be beneficial for this objective, but also revealed potential conflicts of different economic goals.",12,"

In ecology, biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research has seen a shift in perspective from taxonomy to function in the last two decades, with successful application of trait-based approaches. This shift offers opportunities for a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes and services. In this paper, we highlight studies that have focused on BEF of microbial communities with an emphasis on integrating trait-based approaches to microbial ecology. In doing so, we explore some of the inherent challenges and opportunities of understanding BEF using microbial systems. For example, microbial biologists characterize communities using gene phylogenies that are often unable to resolve functional traits. Additionally, experimental designs of existing microbial BEF studies are often inadequate to unravel BEF relationships. We argue that combining eco-physiological studies with contemporary molecular tools in a trait-based framework can reinforce our ability to link microbial diversity to ecosystem processes. We conclude that such trait-based approaches are a promising framework to increase the understanding of microbial BEF relationships and thus generating systematic principles in microbial ecology and more generally ecology.",15,"

23,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:145139,"A guide to analyzing biodiversity experiments
Aims: The aim of this guide is to provide practical help for ecologists who analyze data from biodiversity–ecosystem functioning experiments. Our approach differs from others in the use of least squares-based linear models (LMs) together with restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed models (MMs) for the analysis of hierarchical data. An original data set containing diameter and height of young trees grown in monocultures, 2- or 4-species mixtures under ambient light or shade is used as an example.
Methods: Starting with a simple LM, basic features of model fitting and the subsequent analysis of variance (ANOVA) for significance tests are summarized. From this, more complex models are developed. We use the statistical software R for model fitting and to demonstrate similarities and complementarities between LMs and MMs. The formation of contrasts and the use of error (LMs) or random-effects (MMs) terms to account for hierarchical data structure in ANOVAs are explained.
Important Findings: Data from biodiversity experiments can be analyzed at the level of entire plant communities (plots) and plant individuals. The basic explanatory term is species composition, which can be divided into contrasts in many ways depending on specific biological hypotheses.

Global change affects ecosystem functioning both directly by modifications in physicochemical processes, and indirectly, via changes in biotic metabolism and interactions. Unclear, however, is how multiple anthropogenic drivers affect different components of community structure and the performance of multiple ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality). We manipulated small natural freshwater ecosystems to investigate how warming and top predator loss affect seven ecosystem functions representing two major dimensions of ecosystem functioning, productivity and metabolism. We investigated their direct and indirect effects on community diversity and standing stock of multitrophic macro and microorganisms. Warming directly increased multifunctional ecosystem productivity and metabolism. In contrast, top predator loss indirectly affected multifunctional ecosystem productivity via changes in the diversity of detritivorous macroinvertebrates, but did not affect ecosystem metabolism. In addition to demonstrating how multiple anthropogenic drivers have different impacts, via different pathways, on ecosystem multifunctionality components, our work should further spur advances in predicting responses of ecosystems to multiple simultaneous environmental changes.",15,"

26,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167215,"High mutation rates limit evolutionary adaptation in Escherichia coli
Mutation is fundamental to evolution, because it generates the genetic variation on which selection can act. In nature, genetic changes often increase the mutation rate in systems that range from viruses and bacteria to human tumors. Such an increase promotes the accumulation of frequent deleterious or neutral alleles, but it can also increase the chances that a population acquires rare beneficial alleles. Here, we study how up to 100-fold increases in Escherichia coli’s genomic mutation rate affect adaptive evolution. To do so, we evolved multiple replicate populations of asexual E. coli strains engineered to have four different mutation rates for 3000 generations in the laboratory. We measured the ability of evolved populations to grow in their original environment and in more than 90 novel chemical environments. In addition, we subjected the populations to whole genome population sequencing. Although populations with higher mutation rates accumulated greater genetic diversity, this diversity conveyed benefits only for modestly increased mutation rates, where populations adapted faster and also thrived better than their ancestors in some novel environments. In contrast, some populations at the highest mutation rates showed reduced adaptation during evolution, and failed to thrive in all of the 90 alternative environments. In addition, they experienced a dramatic decrease in mutation rate. Our work demonstrates that the mutation rate changes the global balance between deleterious and beneficial mutational effects on fitness. In contrast to most theoretical models, our experiments suggest that this tipping point already occurs at the modest mutation rates that are found in the wild.",15,"
The abstract explores the impact of increased mutation rates on evolutionary adaptation in E. coli. It highlights that mutations are crucial for evolution as they generate genetic variation for selection to act upon. The study investigates the effects of up to 100-fold increases in mutation rates on adaptive evolution in E. coli through the evolution of multiple replicate populations over 3000 generations. The analysis reveals that while populations with higher mutation rates accumulate greater genetic diversity, this diversity leads to faster adaptation and improved growth in novel environments only for modestly increased mutation rates. However, at the highest mutation rates, populations experience reduced adaptation during evolution and fail to thrive in all of the 90 alternative environments. The study also found a dramatic decrease in mutation rate for some populations at the highest mutation rates, indicating that mutation rate changes the balance between deleterious and beneficial mutational effects on fitness. The study suggests that the tipping point for this balance occurs at the modest mutation rates found in the wild.","
Based on the provided abstract and core themes, there are implications impacting SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being):
- The study highlights the role of mutations in generating genetic variation for selection to act upon, which is fundamental to evolution and ultimately leads to improved health and well-being.
- The findings suggest that moderately increased mutation rates can lead to faster adaptation and improved growth in novel environments, which could potentially lead to better health outcomes for populations exposed to new or changing environmental conditions.

SDG 13 (Climate Action):
- The study sheds light on the effects of mutation rate on evolutionary adaptation, which is relevant to understanding the impacts of climate change on microbial populations.
- As climate change leads to increasing temperatures and environmental stressors, it could potentially trigger higher mutation rates in microbial populations. The study suggests that the effects of increased mutation rates on adaptation and fitness are complex, and could have both positive and negative impacts.
- The findings also indicate that very high mutation rates could lead to a dramatic decrease in mutation rate, which could potentially have implications for the long-term adaptability and survival of microbial populations in a changing climate.

Overall, while the abstract does not directly address any other SDGs, the study's focus on understanding the effects of increased mutation rates on evolutionary adaptation is relevant to various fields, including biotechnology, microbiology, and ecology, and could have implications for developing strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change and promoting sustainable development in these areas.","
SDG 13: Climate Action

The abstract does not directly address SDG 13: Climate Action. However, it touches on the impact of mutation rate on evolutionary adaptation, which can have implications for climate change adaptation. As climate change leads to new environmental conditions, organisms with higher mutation rates may be better adapted to survive and thrive in these new conditions. This is supported by the study's findings that populations with higher mutation rates adapted faster and showed improved growth in some novel environments. However, the study also suggests that the tipping point for the balance between deleterious and beneficial mutational effects on fitness occurs at the modest mutation rates found in the wild, indicating that extreme mutation rates may not be the most adaptive in response to climate change.

SDG 15: Life on Land

The abstract does not directly address SDG 15: Life on Land. However, it provides insights into the mechanisms that govern evolutionary adaptation, which are essential for understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of microbial populations. As microbes play a crucial role in maintaining the health and productivity of terrestrial ecosystems, a better understanding of how mutation rate impacts adaptive evolution can contribute to the conservation and management of these ecosystems.

In conclusion, while the study's findings have implications for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of microbial populations, which could be relevant to SDG 15: Life on Land, the direct relevance of the study to this SDG is limited. Similarly, while the study's findings suggest that mutation rate impacts adaptation to novel environments, which could be relevant to SDG 13: Climate Action, the study's contribution to this SDG is indirect and context-specific. Therefore, the study's relevance to these SDGs is moderate.

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a promising technique for the direct conversion of solar energy into chemical fuels. Colloidal quantum dots with tunable band gap and versatile surface properties remain among the most prominent targets in photocatalysis despite their frequent toxicity, which is detrimental for environmentally friendly technological implementations. In the present work, all-inorganic sulfide-capped InP and InP/ZnS quantum dots are introduced as competitive and far less toxic alternatives for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in aqueous solution, reaching turnover numbers up to 128,000 based on quantum dots with a maximum internal quantum yield of 31%. In addition to the favorable band gap of InP quantum dots, in-depth studies show that the high efficiency also arises from successful ligand engineering with sulfide ions.

One of the primary challenges of our time is to enhance global food production and security. Most assessments in agricultural systems focus on plant yield. Yet, these analyses neglect temporal yield stability, or the variability and reliability of production across years. Here we perform a meta-analysis to assess temporal yield stability of three major cropping systems: organic agriculture and conservation agriculture (no-tillage) vs. conventional agriculture, comparing 193 studies based on 2896 comparisons. Organic agriculture has, per unit yield, a significantly lower temporal stability (−15%) compared to conventional agriculture. Thus, although organic farming promotes biodiversity and is generally more environmentally friendly, future efforts should focus on reducing its yield variability. Our analysis further indicates that the use of green manure and enhanced fertilisation can reduce the yield stability gap between organic and conventional agriculture. The temporal stability (−3%) of no-tillage does not differ significantly from those of conventional tillage indicating that a transition to no-tillage does not affect yield stability.",2,"

The meta-analysis presented in this abstract has implications for several SDGs related to sustainable development, particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

Firstly, the study's finding that organic agriculture has lower temporal yield stability (-15%) than conventional agriculture underscores the importance of SDG 2, which aims to end hunger and achieve food security and improved nutrition. Lower yield stability in organic agriculture means higher risks of crop failure, which can result in food shortages and hunger. This highlights the need for strategies to increase the yield stability of organic agriculture to ensure food security.

Secondly, the authors' suggestion that green manure and enhanced fertilization can improve yield stability in organic agriculture is relevant to SDG 12, which aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. By reducing the yield stability gap between organic and conventional agriculture, this strategy can promote more sustainable and responsible farming practices that reduce environmental impacts and improve resource efficiency.

Synthesis of silicone nanofilaments (SNF) on substrates is a successful approach to fabricate superantiwetting surfaces. However, the yield of SNF is usually very low (<< 1 %). After coating reactions, excessive organosilane residues become wastes and are released to the environment. Here, we report a facile, sustainable, high yield strategy to prepare silicone nanofilament coatings by simply exposing trifunctional silane/toluene solution to air.

Flood hydrograph shapes contain valuable information on the flood-generation mechanisms of a catchment. To make good use of this information, we express flood hydrograph shapes as continuous functions using a functional data approach. We propose a clustering approach based on functional data for flood hydrograph shapes to identify a set of representative hydrograph shapes on a catchment scale and use these catchment-specific sets of representative hydrographs to establish regions of catchments with similar flood reactivity on a regional scale. We applied this approach to flood samples of 163 medium-size Swiss catchments. The results indicate that three representative hydrograph shapes sufficiently describe the hydrograph shape variability within a catchment and therefore can be used as a proxy for the flood behavior of a catchment. These catchment-specific sets of three hydrographs were used to group the catchments into three reactivity regions of similar flood behavior. These regions were not only characterized by similar hydrograph shapes and reactivity but also by event magnitudes and triggering event conditions. We envision these regions to be useful in regionalization studies, regional flood frequency analyses, and to allow for the construction of synthetic design hydrographs in ungauged catchments.

The abstract contributes to three SDGs: SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). The proposed method for identifying regions with similar flood reactivity based on hydrograph shapes can inform strategies related to climate action (SDG 13) by helping authorities understand hydrograph shapes and event magnitudes in different regions, which can aid in the design and implementation of flood protection measures and infrastructure. This knowledge can also inform strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change, as it can help identify areas that may be particularly susceptible to floods as a result of climate change.

The method presented in the abstract can also inform strategies for managing and mitigating flood risk (SDG 6). By identifying regions with similar flood reactivity, authorities can prioritize investments in flood protection measures and infrastructure in areas with higher flood risk. This knowledge can also inform land use and development practices, as areas with high flood risk may require different land use and development strategies than areas with lower flood risk.

The proposed method can also inform sustainable urban planning and development practices (SDG 11). By understanding hydrograph shapes and event magnitudes in different regions, authorities can design more resilient and sustainable urban areas that are better able to withstand floods. This knowledge can also inform land use and development practices, as areas with higher flood risk may require different land use and development strategies than areas with lower flood risk.

Conservation biology aims at identifying areas of rich biodiversity. Currently recognized global biodiversity hotspots are spatially too coarse for conservation management and identification of hotspots at a finer scale is needed. This might be achieved by identification of areas of endemism. Here, we identify areas of endemism in Iran, a major component of the Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspot, and address their ecological correlates. Using the extremely diverse sunflower family (Asteraceae) as our model system, five consensus areas of endemism were identified using the approach of endemicity analysis. Both endemic richness and degree of endemicity were positively related to topographic complexity and elevational range. The proportion of endemic taxa at a certain elevation (percent endemism) was not congruent with the proportion of total surface area at this elevation, but was higher in mountain ranges. While the distribution of endemic richness (i.e., number of endemic taxa) along an elevational gradient was hump-shaped peaking at mid-elevations, the percentage of endemism gradually increased with elevation. Patterns of endemic richness as well as areas of endemism identify mountain ranges as main centres of endemism, which is likely due to high environmental heterogeneity and strong geographic isolation among and within mountain ranges. The herein identified areas can form the basis for defining areas with conservation priority in this global biodiversity hotspot.",15,"
The abstract presents a study on identifying areas of endemism within the Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspot in Iran using the sunflower family as a model system. The study aims to provide a finer scale for conservation management by identifying areas of endemism, as recognized global biodiversity hotspots are too large for practical conservation purposes.

The theory of acceptance sets and their associated risk measures plays a key role in the design of capital adequacy tests. The objective of this paper is to investigate the class of surplus-invariant acceptance sets. We argue that surplus invariance is a reasonable requirement from a regulatory perspective, since the corresponding capital adequacy tests do not depend on the surplus of a financial institution, which benefits exclusively its shareholders, but only on the default profile, which affects its liability holders. We provide a detailed analysis of surplus-invariant acceptance sets and their associated risk measures and we discuss the link with loss-based and excess-invariant risk measures, recently studied by Cont et al.

Climate impact studies regarding floods usually focus on peak discharges and a bivariate assessment of peak discharges and hydrograph volumes is not commonly included. A joint consideration of peak discharges and hydrograph volumes, however, is crucial when assessing flood risks for current and future climate conditions. Here, we present a methodology to develop synthetic design hydrographs for future climate conditions that jointly consider peak discharges and hydrograph volumes. First, change factors are derived based on a regional climate model and are applied to observed precipitation and temperature time series. Second, the modified time series are fed into a calibrated hydrological model to simulate runoff time series for future conditions. Third, these time series are used to construct synthetic design hydrographs. The bivariate flood frequency analysis used in the construction of synthetic design hydrographs takes into account the dependence between peak discharges and hydrograph volumes, and represents the shape of the hydrograph. The latter is modeled using a probability density function while the dependence between the design variables peak discharge and hydrograph volume is modeled using a copula. We applied this approach to a set of eight mountainous catchments in Switzerland to construct catchment-specific and season-specific design hydrographs for a control and three scenario climates. Our work demonstrates that projected climate changes have an impact not only on peak discharges but also on hydrograph volumes and on hydrograph shapes both at an annual and at a seasonal scale. These changes are not necessarily proportional which implies that climate impact assessments on future floods should consider more flood characteristics than just flood peaks.",13,"

The abstract discusses the nonlinear effects of taxation on economic growth, addressing two key observations. First, the tax rates of different countries are not directly related to their growth performance. Second, severely reducing private incentives to invest negatively impacts growth performance. The proposed model suggests that the relationship between taxation and growth is highly nonlinear. Low tax rates have minimal impact on long-term growth rates, but as tax rates rise, the negative impact on growth increases dramatically. The median voter selects tax rates with a small impact on growth prospects, making it challenging to measure the relationship empirically.","
This abstract does not directly address any of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, there are indirect implications for SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

The nonlinear effects of taxation on economic growth highlighted in the abstract have important implications for economic policy and development partnerships. The model suggests that low tax rates have minimal impact on long-term growth rates, which could inform policy decisions around taxation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In LMICs, economic growth is often a key priority for achieving the SDGs, particularly SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). Therefore, policy decisions around taxation could impact these SDGs indirectly.

Moreover, the abstract emphasizes the importance of partnerships in advancing economic development, as the model suggests that the relationship between taxation and economic growth is challenging to measure empirically. This highlights the need for international development partnerships that prioritize research and data collection around taxation and economic growth, particularly in LMICs. This information could inform policy decisions and partnerships around economic development, contributing to SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

In summary, while the abstract does not directly address any of the SDGs, it highlights the importance of economic policy and partnerships for achieving sustainable development, particularly in LMICs.","

Soil ecosystems actively regulate climate by controlling methane and nitrous oxide fluxes into the atmosphere. Soils have been, however, drastically altered by agricultural practices, such as nitrogen amendment which increases nitrous oxide emission while it reduces methane uptakes in well-aerated soils by affecting methane-oxidizing bacteria. New nitrification inhibitors, such as 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), are often applied in combination with nitrogen-based fertilizer to increase plant productivity by increasing available ammonium and inhibiting denitrification processes reducing in turn nitrous oxide emissions. However, the increase in ammonium due to nitrification inhibition might also affect methane oxidizing bacteria. We therefore investigated the effects of nitrogen-based fertilizer and DMPP on methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in an extensively managed grassland. We also determined the spatial distribution of active methane oxidizing bacteria by radiolabeling. Short-term reduction in methane uptake and methanotrophic activity occurred after application of 600 kg N ha−1 while DMPP did not alter methane uptake but reduced nitrous oxide emission. The combination of both radio-labeling and field measurement revealed that methane uptake collapsed in the field when methanotrophic activity was inhibited not only in the surface but also in deeper soil. Finally, both methane uptake and methanotrophic activity recovered with time.",13,"
The abstract focuses on investigating the impacts of nitrogen fertilizer and the nitrification inhibitor DMPP on methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in a grassland ecosystem. Key themes include soil ecosystem regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of agricultural practices on methane and nitrous oxide fluxes, and the use of new nitrification inhibitors to reduce nitrous oxide emissions. The primary methods used include soil sampling, radiolabeling, and field measurements. The study found that while nitrogen fertilizer reduced methane uptake, DMPP did not affect methane but did reduce nitrous oxide emission. Additionally, the study revealed that the collapse of methane uptake in deeper soil coincided with inhibition of methanotrophic activity, both in the field and through radiolabeling. These findings highlight the complex interplay between nitrogen management, greenhouse gas emissions, and microbial activity in soil ecosystems.","

By optimizing fertilizer use and reducing emissions, we can promote more sustainable and environmentally-friendly agricultural production methods.

SDG 13 - Climate Action: The study's findings on the impacts of agricultural practices on greenhouse gas emissions have implications for mitigating climate change. Reducing methane and nitrous oxide emissions through better agricultural management practices could contribute to global efforts to limit global warming.

SDG 15 - Life on Land: The study's focus on soil ecosystems and microbial activity highlights the importance of preserving soil health and promoting sustainable land use practices. By understanding the interplay between nitrogen management, greenhouse gas emissions, and microbial activity in soil ecosystems, we can promote more sustainable and ecologically-sound land use practices.

SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: The study's interdisciplinary approach, combining soil sampling, radiolabeling, and field measurements, highlights the importance of partnerships across scientific disciplines to promote sustainable development. By working together, we can develop more comprehensive and effective solutions to environmental challenges.

Despite concerns about climate change-effects on ecosystems functioning, only little is known on how plant assimilate partitioning changes with temperature. Particularly large temperature-effects might occur in cold ecosystems where critical processes are at their temperature limit.  In this study, we tested temperature effects on carbon (C) assimilate partitioning in a field experiment at the alpine treeline. We warmed and cooled soils of microcosms planted with Pinus mugo or Leucanthemopsis alpina, achieving daily mean soil temperatures (3-10 cm depth) around 5.8, 12.7 and 19.2°C in cooled, control and warmed soils. We pulse-labelled these systems with 14CO2 for one photoperiod and traced 14C over the successive four days. Plant net 14C uptake increased steadily with soil temperature. However, 14C amounts in fungal hyphae, soil microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and soil respiration showed a non-linear response to temperature. This non-linear pattern was particularly pronounced in P. mugo, with five times higher 14C activities in cooled compared to control soils, but no difference between warmed and control soil. Autoradiographic analysis of the spatial distribution of 14C in soils indicated that temperature effects on the vertical label distribution within soils depended on plant species. Our results show that plant growth, in particular root metabolism, is limited by low soil temperature. As a consequence, positive temperature effects on net C uptake may not be paralleled by similar changes in rhizodeposition. This has important implications for predictions of soil C storage, because rhizodeposits and plant biomass strongly vary in their residence time.",13,"

Finding a parking space in urban areas is a daily challenge for drivers across the world, due to the increasing amount of vehicles and the limited amount of parking spaces. Drivers who are looking for a parking space in peak hours are often forced to drive around city blocks until they spot a free parking space. This process is termed in literature “cruising for parking” and is proven to (a) cost a lot of time and gas for drivers, (b) generate unnecessary traffic load, and (c) affect the environment negatively due to increased vehicle emissions. This work proposes a Parking Monitoring and Management System (PMMS) that collects, processes, and presents data about available parking spaces and their tariffs within a geographical region. The end-user application of the PMMS, parkITsmart, delivers at drivers bird’s-eye view concerning the parking availability. To facilitate this, the PMMS gathers data from drivers’, vehicles, their mobile phones, and Parking Inspectors (PIs). This work shows that in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment, “pairing” cars and drivers’ mobile phones, collecting data from their sensors, and from PIs in a parking monitoring and management system, can decrease significantly cruising times for parking and can increase the time demands of the parking controlling process.",11,"

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

The proposed solution, the Parking Monitoring and Management System (PMMS), has the potential to contribute to SDG 11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. By reducing the amount of time drivers spend ""cruising for parking,"" the PMMS can help to alleviate traffic congestion, which is a significant challenge in many urban areas. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, helping to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. Additionally, the PMMS can help to ensure that parking spaces are utilized more efficiently, reducing the need for the construction of new parking facilities and freeing up space for other urban development priorities.

SDG 15: Life on Land

While the PMMS does not appear to have a direct link to SDG 15, which aims to protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, it does have the potential to contribute indirectly. By reducing the amount of time drivers spend ""cruising for parking,"" the PMMS can help to reduce the amount of fuel burned and the associated emissions of pollutants, which can have a positive impact on local air quality. This, in turn, can help to protect the health of local communities and the overall health of local ecosystems, which are often negatively impacted by air pollution. Additionally, by encouraging more efficient use of parking spaces, the PMMS can help to ensure that urban areas are better able to manage their land use priorities, potentially freeing up space for the creation of green spaces and other urban development priorities.

In conclusion, the proposed solution, the Parking Monitoring and Management System (PMMS), has the potential to contribute to both SDG 11 and SDG 15 through its ability to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and promote more efficient use of urban land. While the link between the PMMS and SDG 15 is less direct, it is clear that the PMMS can help to promote more sustainable and resilient urban communities, which is a critical priority for achieving the goals outlined in SDG 11.","

Variables simulated by climate models are usually evaluated independently. Yet, climate change impacts often stem from the combined effect of these variables, making the evaluation of intervariable relationships essential. These relationships can be evaluated in a statistical framework (e.g., using correlation coefficients), but this does not test whether complex processes driven by nonlinear relationships are correctly represented. To overcome this limitation, we propose to evaluate climate model simulations in a more process-oriented framework using hydrological modeling. Our modeling chain consists of 12 regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment–European Domain (EURO-CORDEX) forced by five general circulation models (GCMs), eight Swiss catchments, 10 optimized parameter sets for the hydrological model Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV), and one bias correction method [quantile mapping (QM)]. We used seven discharge metrics to explore the representation of different hydrological processes under current climate. Specific combinations of biases in GCM–RCM simulations can lead to significant biases in simulated discharge (e.g., excessive precipitation in the winter months combined with a cold temperature bias). Other biases, such as exaggerated snow accumulation, do not necessarily impact temperature over the historical period to the point where discharge is affected. Our results confirm the importance of bias correction; when all catchments, GCM–RCMs, and discharge metrics were considered, QM improved discharge simulations in the vast majority of all cases. Additionally, we present a ranking of climate models according to their hydrological performance. Ranking GCM–RCMs is most meaningful prior to bias correction since QM reduces differences between GCM–RCM-driven hydrological simulations. Overall, this work introduces a multivariate assessment method of GCM–RCMs, which enables a more process-oriented evaluation of their simulations.",13,"

This abstract focuses on the relationship between health, cognitive, and socio-emotional skills in early childhood, from birth to age 5, using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). The study employs a dynamic factor model to account for measurement error and explores the interaction and buildup of these skills over time. The findings suggest that health is a significant determinant of early socio-emotional development, while cognitive abilities have a negligible effect on health. Socio-emotional skills, on the other hand, have a positive impact on the evolution of both health and cognitive functions. The study also highlights the high degree of persistence in all facets of human capital during early childhood. Mother's investments are found to be an important determinant of the child's health, cognitive, and socio-emotional development in this critical period of development.

In terms of the Sustainable Development Goals, this research can impact several goals. Firstly, SDG 3, Good Health and Well-being, is directly related to this study as it explores the relationship between health, cognitive, and socio-emotional skills during early childhood. The findings can provide insights into the development of healthy and well-rounded individuals, which is a key aspect of this goal. Secondly, SDG 4, Quality Education, can be impacted as the study highlights the importance of parental investment in this critical period of development. This information can be used to inform education policies and practices, particularly in early childhood education, to ensure that children receive the necessary support and resources to develop their health, cognitive, and socio-emotional skills. Lastly, SDG 17, Partnerships for the Goals, can be impacted as the study's findings can inform partnerships between researchers, policymakers, and educators to ensure that the findings are translated into policies and practices that promote the healthy and well-rounded development of children during early childhood.

In summary, this abstract's findings can contribute to several SDGs, particularly SDG 3 and SDG 4, and highlight the importance of parental investment during early childhood. The study's findings can inform policies and practices related to education, healthcare, and partnerships to promote healthy and well-rounded development during early childhood.","

Background: The topographic complexity typical of alpine landscapes creates a variety of (micro)climatic conditions that may mitigate the effects of a warming climate on alpine plants via such mechanisms as cold air pooling (CAP).
Aims: Our primary objectives were to (1) assess whether landscape potential for CAP as a predictor improved species distribution models (SDMs) projections and (2) quantify the impact of CAP on the microclimate experienced by alpine plants compared to the macroclimate.
Methods: We selected the Maritime Alps as our study area, located on the French–Italian border, and its rare endemic plant, Saxifraga florulenta, as model taxon. We generated a spatial layer in GIS (Geographic Information System) that reflected the potential of the landscape for CAP and ran five SDM algorithms with and without CAP layer as a predictor. Second, we recorded the microclimate plants experience with temperature loggers.
Results: CAP as a predictor decreased the omission error of SDMs, mostly at low and mid elevations, where topography may buffer extreme temperatures, resulting in a more stable microclimate compared to macroclimate.
Conclusions: We have shown that plants in an alpine landscape may be less exposed to climate warming than predicted by macroclimate. Topo-climatic GIS layers for SDM projections in mountain environments should integrate such physical mechanisms as CAP.",15,"

Why do some insurgent groups with associated electoral parties target civilians despite the costs of doing so? Organizations with peaceful electoral wings and violent factions operating at the same time are common in contemporary democracies. One of the more consistent observations in the literature is that insurgent targeting of civilians is costly to their electoral counterpart, and insurgents are aware of this cost. Yet, many insurgent groups continue to target civilians. In this article, we suggest a localized effect of violence on electoral outcomes of parties with ties to violent groups offers an explanation for why such insurgent groups might continue to perpetrate violence. Specifically, we suggest insurgent benefits, measured as electoral costs to the incumbent for failure in stemming the violence, likely outweigh the localized electoral costs to insurgent-affiliated parties from the violence.

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
The abstract's findings suggest that populist attitudes are associated with false consensus and hostile media perceptions. This study's contribution to SDG 10 lies in its examination of the relationship between populist attitudes and perceptions of public opinion and mainstream media reporting. The findings highlight that populist citizens tend to assume that their views align with the majority's (false consensus) and that mainstream media are hostile to their views (hostile media perceptions). This study sheds light on the ways in which populist attitudes contribute to inequality in society, as these assumptions may further entrench existing divides and discourage individuals from engaging in informed public discourse.

SDG 13: Climate Action
While the study's focus is not explicitly related to climate action, the study's findings could have implications for climate communication and public engagement. False consensus and hostile media perceptions could potentially hinder efforts to communicate the urgency and importance of climate action. For example, individuals who believe that their views align with the majority's (false consensus) may not perceive the need for drastic action on climate change, while those who perceive mainstream media as hostile (hostile media perceptions) may disregard or discount scientific evidence. The study's findings highlight the importance of effective climate communication that is sensitive to these perceptions and attitudes.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
The study's findings could also have implications for peace, justice, and strong institutions. False consensus and hostile media perceptions could potentially contribute to polarization and division in society, as individuals may become entrenched in their views and less willing to engage in constructive dialogue and debate. This could, in turn, hinder efforts to build strong institutions and foster peaceful and just societies.

Although much research examines the factors that affect technology adoption and use, less is known about how older adults as a group differ in their ability to use the Internet. The theory of digital inequality suggests that even once people have gone online, differences among them will persist in important ways such as their online skills. We analyze survey data about older American adults’ Internet skills to examine whether skills differ in this group and if they do, what explains differential online abilities. We find that there is considerable variation in Internet know-how and this relates to both socioeconomic status and autonomy of use. The results suggest that attempts to achieve a knowledgeable older adult population regarding Internet use must take into account these users’ socioeconomic background and available access points.",9,"

The presence of antibiotics in treated wastewater and consequently in surface and groundwater resources raises concerns about the formation and spread of antibiotic resistance. Improving the removal of antibiotics during wastewater treatment therefore is a prime objective of environmental engineering. Here we obtained a detailed picture of the fate of sulfonamide antibiotics during activated sludge treatment using a combination of analytical methods. We show that pterin-sulfonamide conjugates, which are formed when sulfonamides interact with their target enzyme to inhibit folic acid synthesis, represent a major biotransformation route for sulfonamides in laboratory batch experiments with activated sludge. The same major conjugates were also present in the effluents of nine Swiss wastewater treatment plants. The demonstration of this biotransformation route, which is removal. related to bacterial growth, helps explain seemingly contradictory views on optimal conditions for sulfonamide More importantly, since pterin-sulfonamide conjugates show retained antibiotic activity, our findings suggest that risk from exposure to sulfonamide antibiotics may be less reduced during wastewater treatment than previously assumed.

Anchored molecular catalysts provide a good step towards bridging the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. However, applications in an aqueous environment pose a serious challenge to anchoring groups in terms of stability. Ultrathin overlayers embedding these catalysts on the surface using atomic layer deposition (ALD) are an elegant solution to tackle the anchoring group instability. The propensity of ALD precursors to react with water leads to the question whether molecules containing aqua ligands, such as most water oxidation complexes, can be protected without side reactions and deactivation during the deposition process. We synthesized two iridium and two ruthenium-based water oxidation catalysts, which contained an aqua ligand (Ir–OH2 and Ru–OH2) or a chloride (Ir–Cl and Ru–Cl) that served as a protecting group for the former. Using a ligand exchange reaction on the anchored and partially embedded Ru–Cl, the optimal overlayer thickness was determined to be 1.6 nm. An electrochemical test of the protected catalysts on meso-ITO showed different behaviors for the Ru and the Ir catalysts. The former showed no onset difference between protected and non-protected versions, but limited stability. Ir–Cl displayed excellent stability, whilst the unprotected catalyst Ir–OH2 showed a later initial onset. Self-regeneration of the catalytic activity of Ir–OH2 under operating conditions was observed. We propose chloride ligands as generally applicable protecting groups for catalysts that are to be stabilized on surfaces using ALD.",7,"

We assess how regional rail service affects air pollution in Germany, where rail service is procured in auctions or negotiations.

Although annual influenza epidemics affect around 10% of the global population, current treatment options are limited and development of new antivirals is needed. Here, using quantitative phosphoproteomics, we reveal the unique phosphoproteome dynamics that occur in the host cell within minutes of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We uncover cellular kinases required for the observed signaling pattern and find that inhibition of selected candidates, such as the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), leads to decreased IAV replication. As GRK2 has emerged as drug target in heart disease, we focus on its role in IAV infection and show that it is required for viral uncoating. Replication of seasonal and pandemic IAVs is severely decreased by specific GRK2 inhibitors in primary human airway cultures and in mice.

This abstract highlights several concepts related to sustainable development, specifically SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), as the study aims to develop new antiviral drugs for influenza A virus (IAV) infections, which can contribute to reducing the prevalence of infectious diseases and improving global health. In addition, the study's focus on primary human airway cultures and its successful results in mice indicate potential applications for the developed antiviral drugs, which could eventually contribute to SDG 3's goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all.

The study's use of quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify cellular kinases necessary for IAV replication also addresses SDG 6's goal of ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Specifically, by inhibiting these kinases, the study suggests that viral replication can be reduced, potentially minimizing the spread of IAV infections and reducing the burden on healthcare systems and resources. As viral infections can contribute to the depletion of finite resources such as clean water and sanitation facilities, reducing the prevalence of such infections can contribute to more sustainable resource management.

Moreover, the study's identification of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a crucial node in the kinase network that enables IAV replication also highlights its role in viral uncoating, which is a critical stage in the IAV replication cycle. The study's success in identifying GRK2 as a potential drug target for IAV infections also contributes to SDG 17's goal of strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development, as the study's findings could potentially lead to collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors to develop and disseminate new antiviral drugs.

BACKGROUND: The zoonotic tapeworm Taenia saginata, although causing only minor discomfort in humans, is responsible for considerable economic losses in the livestock sector due to condemnation or downgrading of infected beef carcasses. An overview of current knowledge on the distribution and prevalence of this parasite in West and Central Africa is lacking.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, collecting information on published and grey literature about T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis from 27 countries/territories in West and Central Africa, published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2017.
RESULTS: The literature search retrieved 1672 records, of which 51 and 45 were retained for a qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Non-specified human taeniosis cases were described for Nigeria, Cameroon, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic Congo, Guinea, and Ivory Coast (seven out of 27 countries/territories), while T. saginata taeniosis specifically was only reported for Cameroon. Most prevalence estimates for taeniosis ranged between 0-11%, while three studies from Nigeria reported prevalence estimates ranging between 23-50%. None of the studies included molecular confirmation of the causative species. The presence of bovine cysticercosis was reported for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tristan da Cunha (14 out of 27 countries/territories). Prevalence estimates ranged between 0-29%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review has revealed that human taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis are seriously understudied in West and Central Africa. The high prevalence estimates of both conditions suggest an active dissemination of this parasite in the region, calling for a concerted One Health action from public health, veterinary health and food surveillance sectors.",3,"

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being

The abstract highlights the health implications of T. saginata taeniosis and cysticercosis, which fall under SDG 3. The study found that while taeniosis is underreported, it has been identified in several countries, including Cameroon, where T. saginata infections have been confirmed. Prevalence estimates for taeniosis range from 0-11%, with higher rates reported in Nigeria. These findings suggest that the health burden of taeniosis is significant in West and Central Africa, and further studies are needed to understand the full scope of the problem.

Bovine cysticercosis, a result of T. saginata infection in cattle, was also identified in 14 out of 27 countries in the region. The study found that prevalence estimates for cysticercosis range from 0-29%. The high prevalence rates of both taeniosis and cysticercosis indicate an active dissemination of the parasite in the region, which could pose a public health risk due to the potential for zoonotic transmission.

Overall, the study suggests that there is a need for improved surveillance and prevention measures to address the health implications of T. saginata taeniosis and cysticercosis in West and Central Africa.

SDG 15: Life on Land

The study also touches upon SDG 15, which aims to promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and habitat loss. T. saginata, like many other parasitic zoonoses, has a complex life cycle that involves transmission between different animal hosts and the environment. This study found that bovine cysticercosis is prevalent in the region, and given that T. saginata requires the ingestion of contaminated beef for human transmission, there is a potential risk of environmental contamination. The study highlights the understudy of both conditions, and further research is needed to understand the full scope of the problem and develop effective prevention and control measures.

The type I interferon (IFN) system plays an important role in controlling herpesvirus infections, but it is unclear which IFN-mediated effectors interfere with herpesvirus replication. Here we report that human myxovirus resistance protein B (MxB, also designated Mx2) is a potent human herpesvirus restriction factor in the context of IFN. We demonstrate that ectopic MxB expression restricts a range of herpesviruses from the Alphaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae, including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). MxB restriction of HSV-1 and HSV-2 requires GTPase function, in contrast to restriction of lentiviruses. MxB inhibits the delivery of incoming HSV-1 DNA to the nucleus and the appearance of empty capsids, but not the capsid delivery to the cytoplasm or tegument dissociation from the capsid. Our study identifies MxB as a potent pan-herpesvirus restriction factor which blocks the uncoating of viral DNA from the incoming viral capsid.",3,"
The abstract presents the discovery that MxB, a human interferon-induced protein, acts as a potent restriction factor against a wide range of herpesviruses, including alphaherpesviruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and gammaherpesviruses (KSHV). The study demonstrates that MxB's restriction of herpesviruses requires its GTPase function and differs from its mechanism of restricting lentiviruses. MxB inhibits the delivery of incoming HSV-1 DNA to the nucleus and the formation of empty capsids, but does not affect capsid delivery to the cytoplasm or tegument dissociation from the capsid during uncoating. The findings reveal MxB as a potent pan-herpesvirus restriction factor that prevents viral DNA delivery to the nucleus.","
The abstract highlights the potential impact of MxB, a human interferon-induced protein, on the prevention of herpesvirus infections, which aligns with SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being. Specifically, the study shows that MxB restricts the replication of herpesviruses from the Alphaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae families, including HSV-1, HSV-2, and KSHV. This finding could lead to the development of new therapies for herpesvirus infections, which affect millions of people worldwide and can cause serious health complications, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems. Additionally, the study's identification of MxB as a potent pan-herpesvirus restriction factor adds to the growing understanding of the human immune system's defense mechanisms against viral infections, which is relevant to SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation and SDG 14 - Life Below Water, as viral infections can lead to waterborne diseases that impact access to clean water and sanitation. Overall, the study's findings contribute to our knowledge of viral restrictions, which could lead to the development of new therapies and prevention strategies for herpesvirus infections, as well as a better understanding of the human immune system's role in viral defense mechanisms.","
SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
- The discovery of MxB as a potent restriction factor against a wide range of herpesviruses has the potential to contribute to SDG 3 by improving global health outcomes. Herpesviruses are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 536 million herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections worldwide in 2016 (World Health Organization, 2019). MxB's ability to restrict the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2, as well as KSHV, could lead to the development of more effective antiviral therapies and preventive strategies.

SDG 15: Life on Land
- Although not immediately apparent, the study's findings may also indirectly contribute to SDG 15 by improving the management of natural resources. KSHV, also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), is associated with the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a type of cancer that disproportionately affects people living in poverty and resource-limited settings (Carrasco-Ríos et al., 2019). By identifying MxB as a potent restriction factor against KSHV, the study may contribute to a better understanding of KS pathogenesis, which could inform the development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies, ultimately reducing the disease's burden on natural resources and economic development in affected communities. 

Overall, while the study's primary focus is on advancing our understanding of the IFN system's role in controlling herpesvirus infections, its findings have the potential to contribute to both SDG 3 and SDG 15 through the development of more effective antiviral therapies and prevention strategies, as well as a better understanding of KSHV pathogenesis. However, it is essential to remain critical and objective in evaluating the study's potential contributions to these SDGs, as the findings' translational potential is still uncertain, and further research is necessary to confirm their clinical relevance.","

Dry grasslands are species rich and ecologically valuable habitats that have experienced a massive decline in Switzerland during the last century due to agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Appropriate management is a key factor in maintaining habitat quality of the remaining most valuable sites and should thus be an essential part of monitoring studies. However, information on management is often missing and fine-scale patterns are difficult to assess, especially over large areas and for past decades.
The aim of this study was to predict habitat quality of protected dry grasslands in Switzerland. Using a nation-wide in-situ vegetation data set with plot-based species lists, we derived six habitat quality indicators (management tolerance, light availability, nutrient content, moisture content and species richness). We then tested how well satellite-based phenology metrics, in combination with environmental and climate data, can predict these dry grassland habitat quality indicators. We expected that the seasonal pattern of vegetation activity, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), would represent local productivity and management patterns, two crucial indicators of dry grassland habitat quality. Linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the relative importance and ecological relationship of different NDVI metrics and other environmental and climate predictors for habitat quality. Variance partitioning was applied to assess model contributions of the three variable groups which represent different data sources for productivity and management.
Accuracies for the habitat quality prediction models ranged between 34% and 57% and significant correlations with multiple NDVI metrics were found. Including NDVI phenology improved all models by 7–12%. Single contributions of NDVI phenology were highest for management tolerance and nutrient content. However, we found high variation of contributions between management types. NDVI metrics were highly informative for the habitat qualities of abandoned sites, but grazing and mowing reduced or even cancelled their predictive power. Moreover, our results demonstrate the limitation of single-date NDVI values in predicting habitat quality of dry grasslands, in particular pastures and meadows. For monitoring applications of dry grasslands, we propose using a combination of NDVI metrics, as our results showed that they greatly improve prediction results of essential habitat qualities. The Landsat legacy dataset facilitates the assessment of habitat changes during past decades and can be complemented in the future with higher resolution data, such as Sentinel-2, to increase the temporal and spatial resolution so analyses are more appropriate for the typically limited size of dry grassland habitat sites in Switzerland.",15,"

Post-copulatory sexual selection (PSS), fuelled by female promiscuity, is credited with the rapid evolution of sperm quality traits across diverse taxa1. Yet, our understanding of the adaptive significance of sperm ornaments and the cryptic female preferences driving their evolution is extremely limited. Here we review the evolutionary allometry of exaggerated sexual traits (for example, antlers, horns, tail feathers, mandibles and dewlaps), show that the giant sperm of some Drosophila species are possibly the most extreme ornaments in all of nature and demonstrate how their existence challenges theories explaining the intensity of sexual selection, mating-system evolution and the fundamental nature of sex differences. We also combine quantitative genetic analyses of interacting sex-specific traits in D. melanogaster with comparative analyses of the condition dependence of male and female reproductive potential across species with varying ornament size to reveal complex dynamics that may underlie sperm-length evolution. Our results suggest that producing few gigantic sperm evolved by (1) Fisherian runaway selection mediated by genetic correlations between sperm length, the female preference for long sperm and female mating frequency, and (2) longer sperm increasing the indirect benefits to females. Our results also suggest that the developmental integration of sperm quality and quantity renders post-copulatory sexual selection on ejaculates unlikely to treat male–male competition and female choice as discrete processes.",15,"

Gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration is a promising tool for low-cost decentralized drinking water production. The biofilms in GDM systems are able of removing harmful chemical components, particularly toxic cyanobacterial metabolites such as microcystins (MCs). This is relevant for the application of GDM filtration because anthropogenic nutrient input and climate change have led to an increase of toxic cyanobacterial blooms. However, removal of MCs in newly developing GDM biofilms is only established after a prolonged period of time. Since cyanobacterial blooms are transient phenomena, it is important to understand MC removal in mature biofilms with or without prior toxin exposure. In this study, the microbial community composition of GDM biofilms was investigated in systems fed with water from a lake with periodic blooms of MC-producing cyanobacteria. Two out of three experimental treatments were supplemented with dead biomass of a MC-containing cyanobacterial strain, or of a non-toxic mutant, respectively. Analysis of bacterial rRNA genes revealed that both biomass-amended treatments were significantly more similar to each other than to a non-supplemented control. Therefore, it was hypothesized that biofilms could potentially be 'primed' for rapid MC removal by prior addition of non-toxic biomass. A subsequent experiment showed that MC removal developed significantly faster in mature biofilms that were pre-fed with biomass from the mutant strain than in unamended controls, indicating that MC degradation was a facultative trait of bacterial populations in GDM biofilms. The significant enrichment of bacteria related to both aerobic and anaerobic MC degraders suggested that this process might have occurred in parallel in different microniches.",6,"

Arable weeds are among those groups of plants that are most threatened in Europe due to management intensification and efficient cleaning of crop seeds in modern agriculture. Plant species loss in arable fields had been assessed in many European countries about 30 years ago, and has gained renewed interest during the last few years. A rich historical data set on plots where arable weeds had historically been recorded in Switzerland enabled the study of changes in arable weed species since the 1920s onward. In total, 232 locations with historical plots were revisited. There, we recorded all plant species and their abundances on 100m2 plots. Across all plots the average number of species per plot declined dramatically by more than 60% during the last 90 years. Most species decreased in frequency, but common species stayed more frequent, while rare species − often characteristic weeds of traditionally managed crop fields − decreased in frequency or even disappeared. Plant groups with increasing species numbers and frequency were mostly neophytes, grasses and species with high nutrient demand. The above mentioned decline in species number and frequency of rare and characteristic weed species suggests that more effective conservation measures than hitherto taken are needed to ensure their preservation.",15,"
The provided abstract focuses on the declining arable flora in Switzerland since the 1920s. The core themes and subjects of this abstract include the threat to arable weed species in Europe due to management intensification and efficient cleaning of crop seeds in modern agriculture, the assessment of plant species loss in arable fields through historical data, and the need for more effective conservation measures. The study involved revisiting 232 locations with historical plots and recording all plant species and their abundances on 100m2 plots. The analysis revealed a dramatic decline in the average number of species per plot by more than 60% during the last 90 years, with most species decreasing in frequency and rare species disappearing. Common species stayed more frequent, while neophytes, grasses, and species with high nutrient demand showed increasing species numbers and frequency. This decline in species number and frequency of rare and characteristic weed species highlights the need for more effective conservation measures to ensure their preservation.","
Based on the core themes, we can identify the following implications impacting SDGs:

SDG 1 - No Poverty: The declining arable flora may lead to a loss of traditional farming practices and associated knowledge, which could disproportionately affect rural communities and contribute to poverty. Additionally, the increasing nutrient demand of species suggests a potential increase in input costs for farmers, potentially exacerbating poverty through higher production costs.

SDG 2 - Zero Hunger: The loss of traditional farming practices and associated knowledge may also impact food security and contribute to hunger. Traditional crop varieties may be more resilient to climate change and pests, and the loss of these varieties could contribute to food insecurity.

SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being: The loss of traditional farming practices and associated knowledge could also impact the health and well-being of rural communities, potentially contributing to malnutrition and other health issues.

SDG 4 - Quality Education: The declining arable flora could impact education opportunities, as traditional farming practices and associated knowledge are often passed down through generations. The loss of this knowledge could lead to a loss of cultural heritage and potentially contribute to lower educational outcomes.

SDG 5 - Gender Equality: Women are often disproportionately affected by poverty, food insecurity, and health issues. Therefore, the implications identified for SDGs 1, 2, and 3 could also impact SDG 5.

SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities: The declining arable flora could also impact urban areas, as the loss of traditional farming practices and associated knowledge could contribute to the loss of cultural heritage and potentially impact the sustainability of urban communities.

SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals: The loss of traditional farming practices and associated knowledge could also impact partnerships for sustainable development, as these practices and knowledge are often shared through traditional networks and partnerships. The loss of this knowledge could potentially weaken these partnerships and hinder sustainable development efforts.

Overall, the declining arable flora has implications for multiple SDGs and highlights the need for more effective conservation measures to ensure the preservation of traditional farming practices and associated knowledge.","

Surveys play a key role in researching public perceptions of and attitudes toward science. Accordingly, there is a breadth of often-used survey instruments available which have also been adopted for segmentation analyses. Even though many of these segmentation solutions are similar in their aims, they often include a large numbers of variables, making it more difficult for other researchers to build on these solutions, as survey time is scarce. Therefore, we demonstrate how a large number of variables that were used for a comprehensive segmentation analysis can be reduced considerably without losing too much information. We develop and test a short survey instrument to segment populations according to their attitudes toward science. Results show that segmentation results can be replicated with over 90% accuracy by reducing the instrument from 20 to 10 variables. This reduction does not significantly affect the predictive power of segment attribution on three dependent variables, which suggests that many segmentation analyses could be similarly optimized, helping researchers save survey time and standardize segmentation analyses more.",12,"

Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves and Cox regression analyses indicated that the tools allowed valid predictions of recidivism according to their intended purposes: The ERASOR was best suited to predict sexual recidivism within 0.5 and 3 years, the J-SOAP II was valid for predictions of sexual and nonsexual-violent recidivism within these recidivism periods, and the VRAG-R showed potential strengths in predicting nonsexual-violent recidivism, especially when committed above age 18. Elevated offense severity and burden of ACEs impeded predictive accuracies of the J-SOAP II and the VRAG-R, particularly in case of sexual recidivism. Our findings emphasize that risk assessment for JSOs must not rely solely on scores derived from risk assessment instruments, but a comprehensive consideration of a JSOs offense severity and psychosocial adversities is additionally necessary to approach accurate risk appraisals.

The abstract discusses the validity of three risk assessment tools - the Juvenile Sex Offender Assessment Protocol II (J-SOAP II), the Estimate of Risk of Adolescent Sexual Offense Recidivism (ERASOR), and the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide-Revised (VRAG-R) - in predicting criminal recidivism among sexually abusive youth. The study found that each tool had varying levels of predictive validity for different types of recidivism and time periods. The ERASOR was best suited for predicting sexual recidivism within 0.5 and 3 years, while the J-SOAP II was valid for predicting both sexual and nonsexual-violent recidivism during these time periods. The VRAG-R showed potential strengths in predicting nonsexual-violent recidivism, particularly when committed above age 18. However, elevated offense severity and burden of adverse childhood experiences impeded predictive accuracies, especially for sexual recidivism. The study emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive consideration of offense severity and psychosocial adversities in addition to scores derived from risk assessment instruments for accurate risk appraisals in sexually abusive youth.","
This abstract touches on SDGs related to justice and education. The study focuses on juveniles who have sexually offended, highlighting the importance of accurate risk appraisals for effective treatment. This aligns with SDG 16, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development and provide access to justice for all. Accurate risk appraisals are essential to ensuring that juveniles receive appropriate treatment and are not subjected to unnecessary punishment.

The study also mentions the Estimate of Risk of Adolescent Sexual Offense Recidivism (ERASOR), which is a tool designed to predict sexual recidivism. This tool can help inform decisions about the appropriate level of supervision or treatment for these juveniles, which can have a significant impact on their future prospects. This aligns with SDG 4, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. By providing appropriate treatment, juveniles are more likely to receive the education and support they need to avoid further criminal activity and lead successful lives.

The study also touches on SDG 10, which aims to reduce inequality within and among countries. It notes that elevated offense severity and burden of adverse childhood experiences impeded predictive accuracies, particularly for sexual recidivism. This suggests that the tools may not be equally effective for all juveniles, and that factors such as offense severity and psychosocial adversities should be considered alongside risk assessment scores. This highlights the importance of addressing inequality in the criminal justice system, to ensure that all juveniles receive appropriate treatment and support, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Overall, this abstract highlights the importance of accurate risk appraisals for juveniles who have sexually offended, and the potential implications for education and justice, as well as the importance of addressing inequality in the criminal justice system. However, it does not make a direct contribution to any of the SDGs, and therefore falls under SDG 0: No Goal.","

Poverty remains one of the most pressing problems facing the world; the mechanisms through which poverty arises and perpetuates itself, however, are not well understood. Here, we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that poverty may have particular psychological consequences that can lead to economic behaviors that make it difficult to escape poverty. The evidence indicates that poverty causes stress and negative affective states which in turn may lead to short-sighted and risk-averse decision-making, possibly by limiting attention and favoring habitual behaviors at the expense of goal-directed ones. Together, these relationships may constitute a feedback loop that contributes to the perpetuation of poverty.

Employment rates for women in Saudi Arabia are very low. By custom, they cannot decide for themselves whether to work or not – they need the consent of their male guardian (either their husband or father). Whether men permit their wives or daughters to work depends crucially on social norms. This policy brief reports evidence that most Saudi men privately believe that women should be allowed to work, but that they underestimate the extent to which other men share their views. Experiments reveal that when men are informed that other men agree about women and work, they are more willing to let their wives take a job. This has real-life consequences: wives of men whose misperceptions about the acceptability of female employment have been corrected are more likely to apply and be interviewed for a job.",5,"

This paper develops a dynamic Heckscher Ohlin Samuelson model with sector-specific human capital and overlapping generations to characterize the dynamics and welfare implications of gradual labor market adjustment to trade. Our model is tractable enough to yield sharp analytic results, that complement and clarify an emerging empirical literature on labor market adjustment to trade. Existing generations that have accumulated specific human capital in one sector can switch sectors when the economy is hit by a trade shock. Nonetheless, the shock induces few workers to switch, generating a protracted adjustment that operates largely through the entry of new generations. This results in wages being tied to the sector of employment in the short-run but to the skill type in the long-run. Relative to a world with general human capital, welfare is improved for the skill group whose type-intensive sector shrinks. We extend the model to include physical capital and show that the transition is longer when capital is mobile. We also introduce nonpecuniary sector preferences and show that larger gross flows are associated with a longer transition.",8,"
This abstract introduces a dynamic trade model with sector-specific human capital and overlapping generations, aiming to analyze the dynamics and welfare implications of gradual labor market adjustment to trade. The paper's contribution to the empirical literature on labor market adjustment to trade is twofold: the model's tractability allows for sharp analytic results, and the analysis of sector-specific human capital sheds light on the dynamics of labor market adjustment.

The model presents a tradeoff between specialized and general human capital. Existing generations with specialized human capital can switch sectors when hit by a trade shock, but this shock induces few workers to switch, leading to a protracted adjustment. The adjustment operates largely through the entry of new generations, which results in wages being tied to the sector of employment in the short-run but to the skill type in the long-run.

The analysis shows that, in the long-run, welfare is improved for the skill group whose type-intensive sector shrinks. This implies that, during the adjustment period, there may be short-term costs, such as wage losses for workers in the shrinking sector. However, these costs are outweighed by the long-term benefits of adjusting to the new trade environment.

The paper also explores the role of mobile capital in the adjustment process. The results show that, when capital is mobile, the transition is longer, as capital can move to the more productive sector, exacerbating the skill premium in the new sector and reducing it in the shrinking sector. This finding suggests that policies that aim to promote sectoral adjustment should also consider the role of mobile capital.

Finally, the paper introduces nonpecuniary sector preferences, showing that larger gross flows are associated with a longer transition. This result highlights the role of preferences in shaping the adjustment process, and underscores the importance of understanding the full range of costs and benefits of trade liberalization.

Overall, this abstract highlights the importance of sector-specific human capital and overlapping generations in understanding the dynamics and welfare implications of labor market adjustment to trade.

The provided abstract relates to several SDGs due to its focus on trade dynamics and labor market adjustment. Specifically, the analysis touches upon SDGs 1, 8, and 9, as it explores the impacts of trade on poverty, economic growth, and industry, innovation, and infrastructure.

Firstly, the analysis shows that, during the adjustment period, there may be short-term costs, such as wage losses for workers in the shrinking sector, which could contribute to poverty. However, in the long-run, welfare is improved for the skill group whose type-intensive sector shrinks, suggesting that trade liberalization could lead to reduced poverty over time.

Secondly, the analysis underscores the role of capital mobility in the adjustment process, highlighting that, when capital is mobile, the transition is longer. This finding suggests that policies that aim to promote sectoral adjustment should also consider the role of mobile capital, in order to maximize economic growth.

Finally, the analysis introduces nonpecuniary sector preferences, showing that larger gross flows are associated with a longer transition. This result highlights the importance of understanding the full range of costs and benefits of trade liberalization in order to promote sustainable economic growth and build resilient infrastructure.

In terms of industry, innovation, and infrastructure, the analysis sheds light on the importance of sector-specific human capital and overlapping generations in understanding the dynamics and welfare implications of labor market adjustment to trade. This insight could inform policies aimed at promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, as well as innovation and infrastructure development.

By combining a media content analysis (N = 605 articles) with a panel survey (N = 1,968) in metropolitan areas of four Western European countries (France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), this study analyzes how citizens’ attitudes toward immigrants are influenced by the right-wing populist communication with which they are confronted in their individual media diet. The results show that anti-immigrant statements in the media lead to more negative cognitions toward immigrants, while populist content leads to more negative emotions. The study, thus, demonstrates that not only anti-immigrant rhetoric but also populism as a thin-centered ideology influence citizens’ attitudes toward immigrants on top of pre-existing attitudes.",10,"

Tundra shrubs are slow-growing species limited by low air temperature and scarce nutrient availability. However, shrub expansion has been widely observed in the Arctic during the last decades and attributed to climate warming. Shift in shrub growth, wood structure and abundance affects the surface albedo and permafrost thawing and these changes may feedback to climate. Despite the importance of shrub–climate feedbacks, uncertainties about shrub growth sensitivity to climate remain. Here, we explored the indirect effects of climate warming on shrub growth (vertical and radial), bark thickness, and bark investment in four arctic shrub species. We combined a field experiment addressing two suggested growth drivers – thawing depth and nutrient availability – with dendroecology in a Siberian tundra ecosystem. We used heating cables to increase the thawing depth. To enhance the nutrient availability, we fertilized the surface soil layers. We found that shrub growth was mainly limited by nutrient availability, as indicated by the fertilization treatment effects on shrub growth ring widths. We also found a bark thickness decrease with the combined soil heating and nutrient addition treatment and a negative correlation between bark investment and growth rate for two of the species. These findings suggest that tundra shrubs, especially deciduous species, will grow faster and taller driven by an increasing nutrient availability in the surface soil layers. However, shrubs might become more vulnerable to pests, herbivory, and climate extremes, such as frost or drought events, due to thinner bark and lower bark investment. Using dendroecological approaches in field experiments simulating projected climate scenarios for the Arctic, and an increasing number of study species and locations will reduce uncertainties related to shrub growth sensitivity to climate and other processes driving shrub dynamics.",13,"

Although terrorism is widely understood to be the politically motivated creation of fear by means of violence in a target group, the nature of that fear is seldom explained or even considered. The present article attempts to close that gap by proposing a definition of terror as the apprehension of (more) violence to come. Because every terrorist act is perceived to be part of a potential series, terror is oriented towards the future and involves the imaginary anticipation of prospective events. On the basis of this definition, I will examine the problematical role of counterterrorist discourse. As the statements of public officials and security experts in the run-up to, and during, the ""War on Terror"" demonstrate, the peculiar dynamic of terror is, seemingly paradoxically, reinforced by counterterrorist rhetoric. With its insistence on the escalatory nature of terrorist violence and its repeated prediction of even worse attacks, counterterrorism contributes to the evocation of terror in the sense proposed here.",16,"

Background: Microsatellite markers are widely used for estimating genetic diversity within and differentiation
among populations. However, it has rarely been tested whether such estimates are useful proxies for genome-wide
patterns of variation and differentiation. Here, we compared microsatellite variation with genome-wide single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess and quantify potential marker-specific biases and derive recommendations for future studies. Overall, we genotyped 180 Arabidopsis halleri individuals from nine populations using 20 microsatellite markers. Twelve of these markers were originally developed for Arabidopsis thaliana (cross-species markers) and eight for A. halleri (species-specific markers). We further characterized 2 million SNPs across the genome with a pooled whole-genome re-sequencing approach (Pool-Seq). 
Results: Our analyses revealed that estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation derived from cross-species and
species-specific microsatellites differed substantially and that expected microsatellite heterozygosity (SSR-He) was not significantly correlated with genome-wide SNP diversity estimates (SNP-He and θWatterson) in A. halleri. Instead, microsatellite allelic richness (Ar) was a better proxy for genome-wide SNP diversity. Estimates of genetic differentiation among populations (FST) based on both marker types were correlated, but microsatellite-based estimates were significantly larger than those from SNPs. Possible causes include the limited number of microsatellite markers used, marker ascertainment bias, as well as the high varianc microsatellite-derived estimates. In contrast, genomewide SNP data provided unbiased estimates of genetic diversity independent of whether genome- or only exome-wide SNPs were used. Further, we inferred that a few thousand random SNPs are sufficient to reliably estimate genome-wide diversity and to distinguish among populations differing in genetic variation.
Conclusions: We recommend that future analyses of genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations
use randomly selected high-throughput sequencing-based SNP data to draw conclusions on genome-wide diversity
patterns. In species comparable to A. halleri, a few thousand SNPs are sufficient to achieve this goal.",15,"

SDG 15: Life on Land

The abstract's relevance to SDG 15 is indirect but significant. The study focuses on understanding the genetic variation and population differentiation in Arabidopsis halleri, which is a plant species. Therefore, the results of this study can contribute to our knowledge of plant evolution and adaptation to different environments, which is essential for achieving SDG 15's target of halting the loss of biodiversity and protecting, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems. By understanding the genetic basis of plant differentiation, we can develop strategies for conservation and management of plant populations, which is crucial for achieving SDG 15's objectives.

However, the study's contribution to SDG 15's targets is limited since the focus is primarily on understanding genetic variation and population differentiation, rather than conservation and management strategies.

We find that having a larger proportion of female peers reduces women’s probability of enrolling in and graduating from STEM programs. Men’s STEM participation increases with more female peers present. In the long run, women exposed to more female peers earn less because they (1) are less likely to work in STEM occupations, and (2) have more children.

This abstract presents a study that investigates how the gender composition of high school peers affects STEM college participation and subsequent occupational outcomes for both men and women. The study uses Danish administrative data to examine within-school variation in gender composition and finds that having a larger proportion of female peers reduces women's probability of enrolling in and graduating from STEM programs, while increasing men's STEM participation. As a result, women exposed to more female peers earn less in the long run, as they are less likely to work in STEM occupations and have more children. These findings suggest that the school peer environment has lasting effects on occupational sorting and contributes to the gender wage gap.

Therefore, monitoring the success and influence of green parties and their impact on mainstream party policies is crucial to achieving these SDGs. However, the study did not specifically address the impact of radical right party success on mainstream party behavior related to these SDGs.","
Based on the analysis provided, it can be inferred that the abstract contributes to the following SDGs:

1. SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation: The study's findings suggest that the success of green parties may lead mainstream parties to de-emphasize environmental policies, potentially hindering progress towards clean water and sanitation. This could have negative consequences for SDG 6, as environmental policies play a crucial role in ensuring access to clean water and sanitation for all.

2. SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production: The study highlights the importance of green parties as issue owners in environmental policy, implying that their success could impact policies related to responsible consumption and production. The potential de-emphasis of environmental policies by mainstream parties as a result of green party success could hinder progress towards SDG 12.

3. SDG 13 - Climate Action: The study suggests that the success of green parties could have significant consequences for climate action policies, as green parties are typically advocates for climate action. Mainstream parties' de-emphasis of environmental policies in response to green party success could impede progress towards SDG 13.

4. SDG 15 - Life on Land: The study's findings imply that green party success could impact policies related to life on land, as green parties are known for their focus on environmental justice and conservation. Mainstream parties' de-emphasis of environmental policies in response to green party success could hinder progress towards SDG 15, particularly in countries where environmental policies are already less equitable.

In light of these findings, it can be ranked as follows:

1. SDG 15 - Life on Land: Green party success could have significant consequences for policies related to life on land, as green parties are typically advocates for environmental justice and conservation. Mainstream parties' de-emphasis of environmental policies in response to green party success could hinder progress towards SDG 15, particularly in countries where environmental policies are already less equitable.

OBJECTIVE: In social-cognitive theory, it is hypothesized that mastery experiences (successfully implementing behaviour change) are a source of self-efficacy, and self-efficacy increases the opportunity for experiencing mastery. Vicarious experiences (seeing others succeed) are suggested as another source of self-efficacy. However, the hypothesis of this reciprocal relationship has not been tested using a day-to-day design.

DESIGN: This article reports findings from two intensive longitudinal studies, testing the reciprocal relationship of self-efficacy and its two main sources within the naturally occurring process of quitting smoking (without intervention). Smokers (Study 1: N = 100 smokers in smoker-non-smoker couples (1,787 observations); Study 2; N = 81 female (1,401 observations) and N = 79 male smokers (1,328 observations) in dual-smoker couples) reported their mastery experiences (not smoking the entire day; in Study 2, mastery experience of partner served as vicarious experience) and smoking-specific self-efficacy for 21 days after a self-set quit date.

METHODS: Time-lagged multilevel analyses were conducted using change-predicting-change models.

RESULTS: Increases in mastery experiences predicted changes in self-efficacy, and increases in self-efficacy predicted changes in mastery experiences in Study 1. Study 2 replicated these results and showed contagion effects (partners' mastery on individuals' mastery and partners' self-efficacy on individuals' self-efficacy), but found no evidence for a link between vicarious experiences (partners' mastery experiences) and individuals' self-efficacy.

CONCLUSIONS: This article demonstrates that mastery experiences and self-efficacy show a reciprocal relationship within smokers during a quit attempt in a day-to-day design, as well as contagion effects in couples when both partners try to quit simultaneously. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject? Self-efficacy is one of the strongest correlates of quitting smoking. Despite the assumptions on how self-efficacy is built formulated by Bandura two decades ago, there is only little empirical evidence on the origins of self-efficacy. The open research questions for these two studies were whether mastery experiences (experiencing success with the new behavior) and vicarious experiences (seeing others succeed) facilitate the smoking cessation process, whether mastery experiences and self-efficacy affect one another reciprocally and whether intimate partners serve as role models for each other. What does this study add? Mastery experiences and self-efficacy are mutually depended on a day-to-day basis within the smoking cessation process. Effects of mastery experiences fade rapidly, indicating that constant successes are needed to keep up self-efficacy. Dual-smoker couples show similar changes in a contagious way - if mastery experiences increase in one person, mastery experiences increase in the partner; if self-efficacy increases in one person, self-efficacy increases in the partner, too. No support for vicarious experiences (mastery experiences in one person affecting self-efficacy in the partner and vice versa) as sources of self-efficacy in the quitting process was found.",3,"
The provided abstract explores the relationship between self-efficacy and mastery experiences during smoking cessation in two intensive longitudinal studies. The study found that there is a reciprocal relationship between mastery experiences and self-efficacy in smokers during a quit attempt, as increases in mastery experiences predict changes in self-efficacy, and vice versa. This relationship is mutually dependent on a day-to-day basis. Additionally, the study found contagion effects in couples, where increases in mastery experiences or self-efficacy in one partner led to similar changes in the other partner. The study did not find support for vicarious experiences, or mastery experiences in one partner affecting self-efficacy in the other partner, as a source of self-efficacy in the quitting process. The study adds to the existing knowledge by providing empirical evidence for the origins of self-efficacy during smoking cessation and highlighting the need for constant successes to maintain self-efficacy.","
Based on the core themes provided, I will analyze the provided abstract focusing on sustainable development, especially in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

While the abstract does not directly relate to the SDGs, it does touch upon Goal 3, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Quitting smoking is a crucial step towards improving health and promoting well-being, which is aligned with this SDG.

The study's focus on self-efficacy and mastery experiences during smoking cessation is also important for Goal 4, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Building self-efficacy and mastery experiences can help individuals develop the skills and confidence they need to make positive changes in their lives, including quitting smoking.

Furthermore, the study's findings about the contagion effects in couples can be linked to Goal 11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. By understanding how partners can influence each other's behavior, this study can inform interventions aimed at promoting sustainable and healthy lifestyles in communities.

Overall, while the study's focus is not directly related to the SDGs, it does touch upon themes that are relevant to these goals, highlighting the importance of understanding the factors that influence healthy behavior change and promoting inclusive and equitable learning opportunities. As such, I would recommend this study for those working towards achieving the SDGs, particularly Goals 3, 4, and 11.

In the wake of the recent successes of populist political actors and discussions about its causes in Europe, the contribution of the media has become an issue of public debate. We identify three roles—as gatekeepers, interpreters, and initiators—the media can assume in their coverage of populist actors, populist ideology, and populist communication. A comparative content analysis of nine thousand stories from fifty-nine news outlets in ten European countries shows that both media factors (e.g., tabloid orientation) and political factors (e.g., response of mainstream parties) influence the extent and nature of populism in the media. Although newspapers in most countries do not overrepresent populist actors and tend to evaluate them negatively, we still find abundant populist content in the news. Several media outlets like to present themselves as mouthpieces of the people while, at the same time, cover politicians and parties with antiinstitutional undertones.",16,"

Understanding rock slope kinematics in steep, fractured bedrock permafrost is a challenging task. Recent laboratory studies have provided enhanced understanding of rock fatigue and fracturing in cold environments but were not successfully confirmed by field studies. This study presents a unique time series of fracture kinematics, rock temperatures and environmental conditions at 3500 m a. s. l.  on the steep, strongly fractured Hörnligrat of the Matterhorn (Swiss Alps). Thanks to 8 years of continuous data, the longer-term evolution of fracture kinematics in permafrost can be analyzed with an unprecedented level of detail. Evidence for common trends in spatiotemporal pattern of fracture kinematics could be found: a partly reversible seasonal movement can be observed at all locations, with variable amplitudes. In the wider context of rock slope stability assessment, we propose separating reversible (elastic) components of fracture kinematics, caused by thermoelastic strains, from the irreversible (plastic) component due to other processes. A regression analysis between temperature and fracture displacement shows that all instrumented fractures exhibit reversible displacements that dominate fracture kinematics in winter. Furthermore, removing this reversible component from the observed displacement enables us to quantify the irreversible component. From this, a new metric – termed index of irreversibility – is proposed to quantify relative irreversibility of fracture kinematics. This new index can identify periods when fracture displacements are dominated by irreversible processes. For many sensors, irreversible enhanced fracture displacement is observed in summer and its initiation coincides with the onset of positive rock temperatures. This likely indicates thawing-related processes, such as meltwater percolation into fractures, as a forcing mechanism for irreversible displacements. For a few instrumented fractures, irreversible displacements were found at the onset of the freezing period, suggesting that cryogenic processes act as a driving factor through increasing ice pressure. The proposed analysis provides a tool for investigating and better understanding processes related to irreversible kinematics.",13,"
This abstract presents a study that investigates the kinematics of fractures in steep, fractured bedrock permafrost on the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps. The study provides unique insights into the spatiotemporal evolution of fracture kinematics over an eight-year period, allowing for an unprecedented level of detail. The study identifies two components of fracture kinematics: reversible (elastic) movements caused by thermoelastic strains, and irreversible (plastic) movements due to other processes. By separating these components, the study proposes a new metric, the index of irreversibility, to quantify the relative irreversibility of fracture kinematics. The study finds that reversible displacements dominate fracture kinematics in winter, and that periods of irreversible enhanced fracture displacement are observed in summer, likely due to thawing-related processes such as meltwater percolation into fractures. In some cases, irreversible displacements are also observed at the onset of the freezing period, suggesting a driving factor of cryogenic processes through increasing ice pressure. The study provides a tool for investigating and understanding processes related to irreversible kinematics in steep, fractured bedrock permafrost.","

In light of novel opportunities to use sensor data to observe individuals' day-to-day mobility in the context of healthy aging research, it is important to understand how meaningful mobility indicators can be extracted from such data and to which degree these sensor-derived indicators are comparable to corresponding self-reports. We used sensor (GPS and accelerometer) and self-reported data from 27 healthy older adults (≥67 years) who participated in the MOASIS project over a 30-day period. Based on sensor data we computed three commonly used daily mobility indicators: life space (LS), travel duration using passive (i.e., motorized) modes of transportation (pMOT) and travel duration using active (i.e., non-motorized) modes of transportation (aMOT). We assessed the degree to which these sensor-derived indicators compare to corresponding self-reports at a within-person level, computing intraindividual correlations (iCorrs), subsequently assessing whether iCorrs can be associated with participants’ socio-demographic characteristics on a between-person level. Moderate to large positive mean iCorrs between the respective self-reported and sensor-derived indicators were found (r = 0.75 for LS, 0.51 for pMOT and 0.36 for aMOT). In comparison to sensor-derived indicators, self-reported LS slightly underestimates, while self-reported aMOT as well as pMOT considerably overestimate the amount of daily mobility. Participants with access to a car have higher probabilities of agreement in the pMOT indicator. Sensor-based assessments are promising as they are “objective”, involve less participant burden and observations can be extended over long periods. The findings of this paper help researchers on mobility and aging to estimate the magnitude and direction of potential differences in the assessed variable due to the assessment methods.",3,"
The abstract explores the comparison between self-reported and GPS-derived indicators of daily mobility in a sample of healthy older adults. The primary themes addressed include the extraction of meaningful mobility indicators from sensor data, the comparability of sensor-derived indicators to corresponding self-reports, and the potential differences in assessed variables due to assessment methods. The methodologies used include the computation of commonly used daily mobility indicators based on sensor and self-reported data from 27 healthy older adults over a 30-day period. The key findings include moderate to large positive mean intraindividual correlations between self-reported and sensor-derived indicators, with self-reported LS slightly underestimating and self-reported active and passive modes of transportation overestimating daily mobility. Participants with access to a car have higher probabilities of agreement in the passive mode of transportation indicator. The paper suggests that sensor-based assessments are promising due to their objectivity, lesser participant burden, and extended observations over long periods. The authors highlight the importance of understanding how meaningful mobility indicators can be extracted from sensor data, particularly in light of novel opportunities to use sensor data to observe individuals' day-to-day mobility in the context of healthy aging research.","
In terms of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this abstract touches on a few relevant themes. Firstly, the importance of healthy aging and accessibility for older adults is highlighted, which aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). The use of sensor data to observe individuals' day-to-day mobility in the context of healthy aging research can provide insights into the daily routines and physical activity levels of older adults, which can inform the development of policies and interventions to support active aging and promote independence and mobility.

Secondly, the paper explores the comparability of sensor-derived indicators of daily mobility to corresponding self-reports, which falls under SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). The authors suggest that sensor-based assessments have the potential to replace or supplement traditional self-report methods, as they are less burdensome for participants and can provide more objective and detailed data on daily mobility. This has implications for the design of future studies and interventions, as sensor data may provide more accurate and comprehensive insights into daily mobility patterns, which can inform the development of infrastructure and transportation systems that are more accessible and user-friendly for older adults.

Finally, the paper also touches on the issue of transportation and mobility, which is related to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). The authors find that participants with access to a car have higher probabilities of agreement in the passive mode of transportation indicator, which suggests that car ownership may play a role in daily mobility patterns. This has implications for the design of transportation systems and policies, as it highlights the importance of considering the needs and preferences of older adults with different transportation options. It also underscores the need for sustainable and accessible transportation solutions that promote active and healthy aging, as outlined in SDG 11.","

Higher water temperatures due to climate change combined with eutrophication of inland waters promote cyanobacterial blooms. Some of the cyanobacteria produce toxins leading to drinking water contamination and fish poisoning on a global scale. Here, we focused on the molecular effects of the cyanobacterial oligopeptide cyanopeptolin CP1020, produced by Microcystis and Planktothrix strains, by means of whole-genome transcriptomics. Exposure of 72 hpf old zebrafish embryos for 96 h to 100 and 1,000 μg/L CP1020 resulted in differential transcriptional alteration of 396 and 490 transcripts (fold change ≥ 2), respectively, of which 68 gene transcripts were common. These belong to genes related to various important biological and physiological pathways. Most clearly affected were pathways related to DNA damage recognition and repair, circadian rhythm and response to light. Validation by RT-qPCR showed dose-dependent transcriptional alterations of genes belonging to DNA damage and repair and regulation of circadian rhythm. This leads to the hypothesis that CP1020 acts on DNA and has neurotoxic activity.

The study found that exposure to CP1020 at concentrations of 100 and 1,000 μg/L for 96 hours resulted in differential transcriptional alterations of 396 and 490 transcripts, respectively. The genes affected include those related to DNA damage recognition and repair, circadian rhythm, and response to light. Validation by RT-qPCR showed dose-dependent transcriptional alterations in genes related to DNA damage and repair and regulation of circadian rhythm. The study suggests that CP1020 acts on DNA and has neurotoxic activity, with potential consequences for human health when consuming contaminated drinking water. This analysis provides novel insights into the molecular effects of this cyanobacterial toxin.","

Nonemployment is often posited as a worker’s outside option in wage setting models such as bargaining and wage posting. The value of this state is therefore a fundamental determinant of wages and, in turn, labor supply and job creation. We measure the effect of changes in the value of nonemployment on wages in existing jobs and among job switchers. Our quasi-experimental variation in nonemployment values arises from four large reforms of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit levels in Austria. We document that wages are insensitive to UI benefit levels: point estimates imply a wage response of less than USD 0.01 per USD 1.00 UI benefit increase, and we can reject sensitivities larger than 0.03. In contrast, a calibrated Nash bargaining model predicts a sensitivity of 0.39 – more than ten times larger. The empirical insensitivity holds even among workers with a priori low bargaining power, with low labor force attachment, with high predicted unemployment duration, among job switchers and recently unemployed workers, in areas of high unemployment, in firms with flexible pay policies, and when considering firm-level bargaining. The insensitivity of wages to the nonemployment value we document presents a puzzle to widely used wage setting protocols, and implies that nonemployment may not constitute workers’ relevant threat point. Our evidence supports wage-setting mechanisms that insulate wages from the value of nonemployment.",8,"
The abstract presents a study on the relationship between nonemployment, wages, and unemployment insurance (UI) benefit levels in Austria. The core themes and subjects of the study include:

1. The value of nonemployment: Nonemployment is considered a worker's outside option in wage setting models, which affects their bargaining power and wage negotiations. The study aims to measure the effect of changes in the value of nonemployment on wages.

2. UI benefit levels: The study uses four large reforms of UI benefit levels in Austria as a source of quasi-experimental variation to measure the effect of changes in nonemployment values on wages.

3. Wages: The study documents that wages are insensitive to UI benefit levels, with a wage response of less than $0.01 per $1.00 UI benefit increase. This finding contradicts the prediction of a calibrated Nash bargaining model, which suggests a sensitivity of 0.39.

4. Labor supply and job creation: As wages are insensitive to UI benefit levels, the study implies that nonemployment may not constitute workers' relevant threat point, presenting a puzzle to widely used wage setting protocols.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of wage setting mechanisms and suggest that nonemployment may not be a significant factor in wage negotiations, contrary to traditional wage setting models. The study's methodology involves using reforms to UI benefit levels to measure the effect of changes in nonemployment values on wages, and it considers various factors that could influence the relationship between nonemployment and wages, such as bargaining power, labor force attachment, unemployment duration, job switchers, and recently unemployed workers.

This abstract focuses on the relationship between nonemployment, wages, and UI benefit levels in Austria. Its core themes include the value of nonemployment, UI benefit levels, and wages. While the study does not explicitly address the SDGs, it sheds light on issues related to poverty (SDG 1) and decent work and economic growth (SDG 8).

The study's findings suggest that nonemployment may not be a significant factor in wage negotiations, which could have implications for the labor market and poverty reduction efforts. If nonemployment does not constitute a worker's relevant threat point, it may be less likely for workers to leave their current jobs in search of better opportunities, which could lead to higher employment rates and lower poverty levels. Additionally, the study's findings could inform policies related to UI benefit levels and job creation. If wages are insensitive to UI benefit levels, it may not be necessary to increase these benefits as a way of stimulating job creation, as it may not have a significant effect on wages or labor supply.

The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in very young children depends on the diagnostic criteria. Thus far, studies have investigated the International Classification of Diseases (11th rev.; ICD-11) criteria for PTSD only in samples of children older than 6 years of age. The aim of this study was to test the diagnostic agreement between the ICD-11 and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) criteria for children who are 6 years old and younger. Caregivers of children aged 3-6 years in foster care in Germany (N = 147) and parents of children aged 1-4 years who had attended a hospital in Switzerland following burn injuries (N  = 149) completed a questionnaire about children's PTSD. Rates of PTSD were calculated according to ICD-11 (considering a specific and a more general conceptualization of intrusive memories) and DSM-5 criteria and were compared using McNemar's tests and Cohen's kappa. The proportion of children who met the ICD-11 criteria was 0.6-25.8% lower than the proportion of PTSD cases according to the DSM-5 criteria. The diagnostic agreement between each ICD-11 algorithm and DSM-5 was moderate, κ = 0.52-0.66. A systematic investigation of adaptions of the ICD-11 avoidance cluster identified alternative symptom combinations leading to higher agreement with the DSM-5 requirements. Furthermore, DSM-5 had higher predictive power for functional impairment than the ICD-11 algorithms. In conclusion, the findings suggest that the ICD-11 criteria show less sensitivity in very young children, which can be explained by the more stringent avoidance cluster.",3,"

Marine coastal ecosystems are among the most exposed to global environmental change, with reported effects on species biomass, species richness and length of trophic chains. By combining a biologically informed food-web model with information on anthropogenic influences in 701 sites across the Caribbean region, we show that fishing effort, human density and thermal stress anomaly are associated with a decrease in local food-web persistence. The conservation status of the site, in turn, is associated with an increase in food-web persistence. Some of these associations are explained through effects on food-web structure and total community biomass. Our results unveil a hidden footprint of human activities.

92,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:159722,"Multimodal route planning with public transport and carpooling
Increasing mobility demands raise the pressure on existing transport networks. As the most used mode of transport, private cars have a particularly strong environmental impact and produce congestion. Ridesharing or carpooling, where a driver and several riders form a carpool, can help to address these issues by increasing the number of persons per car. Therefore, recent years have seen a strong interest in carpooling. However, there exists no effective method of integrating carpooling into transport trip planners as of now, mainly due to the fuzzy and flexible nature e.g., no fixed stops, possibility of making detours of carpooling. This hinders the acceptance of carpooling by the general public. This paper proposes a new method to merge public transport and carpooling networks for multimodal route planning, considering the fuzziness and flexibility brought by carpooling. It is based on the concept of drive-time areas and points of action. The evaluation with real-world data sets shows that, compared with the state-of-the-art method, the proposed method merges static i.e., public transport and dynamic/fuzzy i.e., carpooling networks better, while retaining the desired flexibility offered by the latter, and thus creates a higher interconnectivity between the networks. Meanwhile, the merged network enables multimodal route planning, which can provide users with trips from an origin to a destination using different combinations of modes.",12,"

To reduce poverty and food insecurity in Africa requires raising productivity in agriculture. Systematic use of fertilizer and hybrid seed is a pathway to increased productivity, but adoption of these technologies remains low. We investigate whether the quality of agricultural inputs can help explain low take-up. Testing modern products purchased in local markets, we find that 30% of nutrient is missing in fertilizer, and hybrid maize seed is estimated to contain less than 50% authentic seeds. We document that such low quality results in low average returns. If authentic technologies replaced these low-quality products, however, average returns are high. To rationalize the findings, we calibrate a learning model using data from our agricultural trials. Because agricultural yields are noisy, farmers’ ability to learn about quality is limited and this can help explain the low quality equilibrium we observe, but also why the market has not fully collapsed.",2,"
Core themes: 

1. Poverty and food insecurity in Africa: The abstract highlights the need to raise productivity in agriculture to reduce poverty and food insecurity in Africa.

2. Low adoption of fertilizer and hybrid seed: The low adoption of fertilizer and hybrid seed is identified as a pathway to increased productivity, but the abstract points out that take-up remains low.

3. Quality of agricultural inputs: The authors investigate whether the quality of agricultural inputs can help explain low take-up and find that 30% of nutrient is missing in fertilizer and hybrid maize seed contains less than 50% authentic seeds.

4. Low quality equilibrium: The authors document that low quality results in low average returns, and if authentic technologies replaced low-quality products, average returns would be high.

5. Learning model: The authors calibrate a learning model using data from their agricultural trials to rationalize the findings.

Methodologies/approaches: 

1. Testing modern products: The authors test modern products purchased in local markets to find that 30% of nutrient is missing in fertilizer and hybrid maize seed contains less than 50% authentic seeds.

2. Agricultural trials: The authors use data from their agricultural trials to calibrate a learning model.

Key findings/conclusions: 

1. Low quality agricultural inputs result in low average returns, which can help explain low adoption.

2. If authentic technologies replaced low-quality products, average returns would be high.

3. The market for low-quality agricultural inputs has not collapsed due to limited ability to learn about quality, as a result of noisy agricultural yields.

4. The findings suggest that improving the quality of agricultural inputs could increase adoption and productivity, thus helping to reduce poverty and food insecurity in Africa.","
This abstract highlights several aspects related to sustainable development and the SDGs. 

Firstly, it focuses on poverty and food insecurity in Africa, which is directly linked to SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). The abstract suggests that raising productivity in agriculture through the adoption of modern technologies such as fertilizer and hybrid seed could help reduce poverty and hunger.

Secondly, the authors point out that low adoption of these technologies remains a challenge, which could hinder progress towards SDG 1 and 2.

Thirdly, the authors investigate the quality of agricultural inputs as a possible explanation for low adoption. This relates to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). The authors find that low-quality agricultural inputs such as fertilizer and seeds are common in local markets, which could lead to low returns and deter farmers from adopting these technologies. This is a significant challenge for sustainable agriculture and production as it hinders the transition to more sustainable practices and technologies.

Fourthly, the authors suggest that replacing low-quality products with authentic ones could result in higher returns, which could encourage more farmers to adopt modern technologies. This is also related to SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), as higher returns could lead to increased economic opportunities for farmers and contribute to sustainable economic growth.

Finally, the authors use data from agricultural trials to rationalize their findings, which highlights the importance of evidence-based decision-making for sustainable development. This is closely related to SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), which emphasizes the need for partnerships and cooperation to promote sustainable development.

Overall, this abstract touches upon several SDGs and highlights the importance of addressing the quality of agricultural inputs for sustainable agriculture and production, as well as the need for evidence-based decision-making and partnerships for sustainable development.","
SDG 2: Zero Hunger
The abstract highlights the need to raise productivity in agriculture to reduce poverty and food insecurity in Africa, which directly aligns with SDG 2. The authors' findings on the low quality of agricultural inputs and their impact on average returns suggest that improving the quality of these inputs could increase productivity and reduce hunger in affected areas.

SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
Improving the quality of agricultural inputs could also contribute to SDG 8 by increasing productivity, which in turn could lead to job creation and economic growth in affected communities. Additionally, by raising productivity and reducing food insecurity, the authors' findings could help to reduce poverty and promote decent work opportunities.

SDG 15: Life on Land
The authors' findings on the low quality of agricultural inputs could also have implications for SDG 15, as the low quality of fertilizer and hybrid seed could result in environmental degradation due to increased use of inputs in an attempt to compensate for their lower quality. Improving the quality of these inputs could therefore contribute to more sustainable agricultural practices and promote environmental stewardship.

In summary, the authors' findings align with SDGs 2, 8, and 15, and their research has the potential to contribute to achieving these goals by improving the quality of agricultural inputs and promoting more sustainable agricultural practices.","
The abstract highlights the need to address the quality of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizer and seeds, to increase productivity in agriculture and reduce poverty and food insecurity in Africa, aligning with SDGs 1 (No Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), and 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). The authors find that low-quality inputs, with nutrient deficiencies and low authenticity, result in low average returns, deterring farmers from adopting modern technologies. However, replacing these low-quality inputs with authentic ones could lead to higher returns, encouraging adoption and contributing to sustainable economic growth. Improving input quality could also promote more sustainable agricultural practices, contributing to SDG 15 (Life on Land). Overall, the authors' findings highlight the importance of addressing input quality for sustainable agriculture and production and contribute to achieving SDGs 1, 2, 8, and 15.","
Based on the insights, we can determine that the abstract contributes to the following SDGs, ranked in order of magnitude of contribution:

1. SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth
2. SDG 1 - No Poverty
3. SDG 2 - Zero Hunger
4. SDG 15 - Life on Land

The impact on SDG 8 is significant as improving input quality can lead to increased productivity and sustainable economic growth, promoting decent work and economic opportunities. The impact on SDG 1 and 2 is also significant, as increasing productivity and reducing food insecurity can contribute to poverty reduction and hunger eradication. Lastly, the impact on SDG 15 is also significant, as improving input quality can contribute to more sustainable agricultural practices and conserve natural resources.

While the abstract does not explicitly address SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) or SDG 13 (Climate Action), there is potential for input quality to impact these SDGs as well. Low-quality inputs can result in poor health outcomes for farmers and their families due to exposure to hazardous chemicals or pesticides. Additionally, low-quality inputs may contribute to climate change by reducing the efficiency of inputs or contributing to soil degradation. However, further research would be needed to determine the full extent of these impacts.

Overall, the abstract's contribution towards the SDGs is crucial as it highlights the importance of addressing input quality for sustainable agriculture and production. By improving input quality, we can contribute to achieving multiple SDGs simultaneously and promote more sustainable and equitable agricultural systems.","

During leaf litter decomposition, nutrients are released, can be transferred among different litter species, are metabolized by soil organisms and are taken up by plants again. However, it remains unclear to which extent leaf litter species richness affects these processes of nutrient cycling, and whether effects on one of those processes propagate to the subsequent one. We established a common garden decomposition experiment in a Chinese subtropical secondary forest, to trace two essential nutrients during decomposition and their uptake by plants along a litter species diversity gradient. Unlabelled, and 15N and Li (as surrogate for K) labelled leaves of three native tree species were used to create replicated 1-, 2- and 3-species mixtures, each with one species labelled per mixture. Litter mixtures were placed in mesocosms with one growing herbaceous phytometer plant. Over six months, litter and phytometer plants of each mixture were sampled at four points in time and the different process steps of nutrient dynamics were determined. Our results showed species and nutrient specific decomposition dynamics, which propagated through the processes of mass loss, nutrient release and transfer among species, and nutrient uptake dynamics of phytometer plants. However, we found no litter species diversity effects along the different litter decomposition processes. Rather specific diversity effects occurred in few cases at different points in time for mass loss, Li release and transfer dynamics. These effects were not caused by nutrient transfer from labelled to unlabelled litter, suggesting that species identity effects on decomposer dynamics may outweigh effects of nutrient transfer among litter species in mixtures. Further, the observed litter species diversity effects did not affect the 15N uptake of phytometer plants. Hence, the influence of species diversity on nutrient cycling and plant available nutrient stocks is mainly determined by the amount and variety of chemical compounds that different species exhibit and release to the soil.",15,"

This article investigates the supply side of women's political representation by focusing on how the election of female politicians affects the motivation of women to run for office in other units. The analysis relies on an original data set of over 1,500 municipal elections in Switzerland, starting with the first election after the introduction of women's suffrage. In the first election in which women could participate, the election of a woman in a given municipality was associated in the next election with an additional female candidate in 10% of its neighbors. The relationship decreases over time, fades away after 16 years, and is driven primarily by new female candidates in units where no female incumbents are running for reelection. These findings suggest that role models are important for improving women's representation, but only in its early stages.

Global biodiversity is eroding due to anthropogenic causes, such as climate change, habitat loss, and trophic simplification of biological communities. Most studies address only isolated causes within a single group of organisms; however, biological groups of different trophic levels may respond in particular ways to different environmental impacts. Our study used natural microcosms to investigate the predicted individual and interactive effects of warming, changes in top predator diversity, and habitat size on the alpha and beta diversity of macrofauna, microfauna, and bacteria. Alpha diversity (i.e., richness within each bromeliad) generally explained a larger proportion of the gamma diversity (partitioned in alpha and beta diversity). Overall, dissimilarity between communities occurred due to species turnover and not species loss (nestedness). Nevertheless, the three biological groups responded differently to each environmental stressor. Microfauna were the most sensitive group, with alpha and beta diversity being affected by environmental changes (warming and habitat size) and trophic structure (diversity of top predators). Macrofauna alpha and beta diversity was sensitive to changes in predator diversity and habitat size, but not warming. In contrast, the bacterial community was not influenced by the treatments. The community of each biological group was not mutually concordant with the environmental and trophic changes. Our results demonstrate that distinct anthropogenic impacts differentially affect the components of macro and microorganism diversity through direct and indirect effects (i.e., bottom‐up and top‐down effects). Therefore, a multitrophic and multispecies approach is necessary to assess the effects of different anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity.",14,"

(Q J Econ 130(1):219–266, 2015), we compare the voluntary internalization of negative social impacts by market actors in cases where the negative externality is diffused among many subjects or is concentrated on a single subject. We (1) replicate earlier results demonstrating substantial degrees of market social responsibility and (2) find that the willingness of market actors to act pro-socially is only slightly affected by whether the impacts are concentrated or diffused.",8,"
The abstract ""On the scope of externalities in experimental markets"" examines the impact of the scope of negative externalities on market actors' willingness to exhibit social responsibility. Using the experimental paradigm introduced by Bartling et al. (2015), the study compares the voluntary internalization of negative social impacts by market actors in cases where the negative externality is diffused among many subjects or concentrated on a single subject. The findings reveal that while market social responsibility is significant, the willingness to act pro-socially is only slightly affected by whether the impacts are concentrated or diffused, as demonstrated by the study's replication of earlier results in this regard. In summary, this abstract addresses the theme of social responsibility in the context of market activity and the role of negative externalities in shaping this behavior. The study's methodology is experimental economics, and the primary conclusion is that the degree of social responsibility does not vary significantly based on whether negative externalities are diffused or concentrated.","
In terms of its relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this abstract touches on several core themes. 

Firstly, the study's focus on social responsibility aligns with SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities. By exploring how market actors respond to negative externalities, the study sheds light on the ways in which social and environmental costs are distributed among different actors in a market system. This insight can inform policy decisions aimed at reducing inequality and promoting social justice, particularly in industries that generate significant negative externalities.

Secondly, the study's use of an experimental economics approach can inform SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. By understanding how social responsibility emerges in controlled laboratory environments, researchers can gain insights into how to foster social responsibility and mitigate negative externalities in real-world settings. This knowledge can inform partnerships between governments, businesses, and civil society organizations aimed at achieving the SDGs.

Lastly, the study's focus on negative externalities highlights the importance of SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. By exploring how market actors respond to negative externalities, the study sheds light on the ways in which consumption patterns and production methods can generate social and environmental costs that are not fully reflected in market prices. This insight can inform policies aimed at promoting more sustainable and equitable consumption and production patterns, in line with SDG 12.

Overall, while the abstract does not explicitly address any of the SDGs, its focus on social responsibility, experimental economics, and negative externalities touches on several core themes related to sustainable development and social justice. As such, the study's findings can inform policy decisions aimed at achieving these goals, particularly in industries that generate significant negative externalities.","
SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth
The abstract's relevance to SDG 8 is indirect but still present. Market social responsibility, as demonstrated by the study, involves voluntary actions that minimize negative social impacts in market activities. Such actions promote responsible business practices, which can lead to improved economic growth and job creation, aligning with SDG 8's objectives. However, the study's focus on negative externalities and market social responsibility is primarily related to the environmental and social dimensions of SDG 8, rather than economic growth per se.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
The study's relevance to SDG 12 is more direct. By examining the impact of the scope of negative externalities on market actors' willingness to exhibit social responsibility, the study contributes to a better understanding of how to promote responsible consumption and production. Negative externalities, which are often unaccounted for in market activities, can harm the environment and society, resulting in unsustainable production and consumption patterns. By understanding how market actors respond to negative externalities, policymakers and businesses can develop more effective strategies to promote responsible consumption and production.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals
The study's relevance to SDG 17 is less direct but still present. By using the experimental paradigm introduced by Bartling et al. (2015), the study highlights the importance of collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts in achieving the SDGs. Collaboration between economists, psychologists, and other social scientists can lead to a better understanding of the complex interrelationships between market activities, negative externalities, and social responsibility, contributing to more effective policies and strategies for achieving the SDGs.","
In summary, the abstract ""On the scope of externalities in experimental markets"" explores the impact of the scope of negative externalities on market actors' willingness to exhibit social responsibility using the experimental economics approach. While the study does not explicitly address any of the SDGs, its focus on social responsibility, negative externalities, and experimental economics touches on several core themes related to sustainable development and social justice, including SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, and SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. By shedding light on how market actors respond to negative externalities, the study can inform policies aimed at promoting more sustainable and equitable consumption and production patterns, particularly in industries that generate significant negative externalities. Ultimately, the study's findings can contribute to more effective policies and strategies for achieving the SDGs, particularly in terms of responsible consumption and production.","

There is substantial evidence that women tend to support different policies and political candidates than men. Many studies also document gender differences in a variety of important preference dimensions, such as risk-taking, competition and pro-sociality. However, the degree to which differential voting by men and women is related to these gaps in more basic preferences requires an improved understanding. We conduct an experiment in which individuals in small laboratory “societies” repeatedly vote for redistribution policies and engage in production. We find that women vote for more egalitarian redistribution and that this difference persists with experience and in environments with varying degrees of risk. This gender voting gap is accounted for partly by both gender gaps in preferences and by
expectations regarding economic circumstances. However, including both these controls in a regression analysis indicates that the latter is the primary driving force. We also observe policy differences between male- and female-controlled groups, though these are substantially smaller than the mean individual differences - a natural consequence of the aggregation of individual.

This abstract explores the relationship between gender preferences and political voting for redistribution. The study, conducted in a laboratory setting, finds that women consistently vote for more egalitarian redistribution policies than men, and this gap persists over time and in varying levels of risk. The gender voting gap is partly explained by differences in basic preferences, particularly regarding risk-taking and pro-sociality. However, the study suggests that expectations regarding economic circumstances are the primary driver of this gap, as controlling for both preference and circumstance gaps in a regression analysis reveals a smaller effect from preference gaps alone. The study also notes that there are policy differences between male- and female-controlled groups, but these are smaller than the individual preference differences due to the aggregation of individual preferences into collective outcomes.","
This abstract sheds light on the relationship between gender preferences and political voting for redistribution, which has implications for SDGs related to gender equality (SDG 5) and poverty alleviation (SDG 1). The study finds that women tend to vote for more egalitarian redistribution policies than men, suggesting that gender may influence political decision-making related to redistributive policies. This gap persists over time and in varying levels of risk, indicating that it is not solely driven by temporary factors. The study also highlights the role of expectations regarding economic circumstances in driving this gap, implying that policies that address economic circumstances could potentially reduce the gender voting gap. The study's findings also indicate that there are policy differences between male- and female-controlled groups, though these are smaller than the individual preference differences due to the aggregation of individual preferences into collective outcomes. This suggests that policies aimed at addressing gender disparities should consider both individual preferences and group dynamics. Overall, the study provides insights into the complex relationship between gender preferences and political decision-making, which could inform policy-making related to SDGs related to gender equality and poverty alleviation.","
SDG 5: Gender Equality
The abstract clearly addresses SDG 5, which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

This paper argues that the current EPRDF/TPLF government emulates the imperial ambition of high-modernist development in Ethiopia’s “last” frontier – the pastoral lowlands. We show that two pillars of imperial state expansion continue to haunt Ethiopia’s post-imperial statecraft in the pastoral lowlands: the frontier rush and a high-modernist ambition. The frontier rush is characterized by emptying land for private and state appropriation. The model of high modernism underpins political projects of legitimating state rule, violent land appropriation and suppression of dissent in the pastoral frontier. Our empirical material combines a review of the literature on Ethiopia’s history of high-modernist ambitions with a detailed case study of contemporary land dispossessions in two sites of Lower Omo Valley in Southern Ethiopia. Our case study shows how government officials and company managers mobilize frontier imaginations and high-modernist terminology to justify large-scale relocations of pastoral communities.",16,"

We study the impact of international long-distance flights on the global spatial allocation of economic activity. To identify causal effects, we exploit variation due to regulatory and technological constraints which give rise to a discontinuity in connectedness between cities at a distance of 6,000 miles. We show that improving an airport’s position in the network of air links has a positive effect on local economic activity, as captured by satellite-measured night lights. We find that air links increase business links, showing that the movement of people fosters the movement of capital. In particular, this is driven mostly by capital flowing from high-income to middle-income (but not low-income) countries.

Elderly people with functional limitations are predominantly cared for by family members. Women – spouses and daughters – provide most of this care work. In principle, gender inequality in intergenerational care may have three causes: first, daughters and sons have different resources to provide care; second, daughters and sons respond differently to the same resources; third, welfare state programmes and cultural norms affect daughters and sons differently. In this paper, we address the empirical question whether these three assumed causes are in fact responsible for gender differences in intergenerational care. The empirical analyses, based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), reveal that parents in need are in fact more likely to receive care from daughters than from sons. Daughters are more responsive to the needs of their parents than sons and respond differently to the same resources. Gender inequality is highest in countries with a high level of intergenerational care, high public spending on old-age cash-benefits, a low provision of professional care services, high family obligation norms and a high level of gendered division of labour. Welfare state programmes reduce or increase gender inequality in intergenerational care by reducing or increasing the engagement of daughters in intergenerational care. In general, care-giving by sons is hardly influenced by social care policies.",5,"

The study reveals that parents with functional limitations are more likely to receive care from daughters than sons, with daughters being more responsive to their parents' needs than sons. This gender difference is influenced by cultural norms, family obligation, and the level of gendered division of labor. The study finds that gender inequality in intergenerational care is highest in countries with a high level of intergenerational care, high public spending on old-age cash benefits, a low provision of professional care services, high family obligation norms, and a high level of gendered division of labor. Welfare state policies can either reduce or increase gender inequality in intergenerational care by affecting daughters' engagement in caregiving. However, caregiving by sons is generally not significantly influenced by social care policies.","
This abstract discusses gender differences in intergenerational care within European welfare states. It highlights that women, particularly spouses and daughters, provide the majority of care work for elderly individuals with functional limitations. The study investigates three potential causes for gender inequality in caregiving: differing resources, differing responses to resources, and differential effects of welfare state programs and cultural norms. The research, based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), reveals that parents in need are more likely to receive care from daughters than sons, and daughters are more responsive to their parents' needs than sons. Gender inequality in caregiving is highest in countries with a high level of intergenerational care, high public spending on old-age cash benefits, a low provision of professional care services, high family obligation norms, and a high level of gendered division of labor. Welfare state policies can either reduce or increase gender inequality in caregiving by impacting daughters' involvement in caregiving, but caregiving by sons is not significantly affected by these policies.

This abstract provides insights into several SDGs. The discussion on cultural norms and the gendered division of labor touches upon SDG 5: Gender Equality. The study indicates that gender inequality in caregiving is highest in countries with a high level of gendered division of labor, implying that SDG 5 efforts to promote gender equality could potentially address this issue. Moreover, the study highlights that welfare state policies can impact gender inequality in caregiving (SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals), as these policies can either reduce or increase daughters' engagement in caregiving. Finally, the discussion on the provision of professional care services (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being) and public spending on old-age cash benefits (SDG 1: No Poverty) touches upon these SDGs as well. The study suggests that a lack of professional care services and high public spending on old-age cash benefits may contribute to gender inequality in caregiving. Therefore, efforts to promote universal health coverage (SDG 3) and poverty reduction (SDG 1) could potentially address these issues and contribute to reducing gender inequality in caregiving.","
SDG 5: Gender Equality
The abstract clearly highlights the existence of gender differences in intergenerational care and aims to understand the causes of these disparities. The study reveals that daughters are more likely to provide care to elderly parents with functional limitations and are more responsive to their parents' needs than sons. The study also identifies cultural norms, family obligation, and the level of gendered division of labor as factors influencing gender inequality in intergenerational care. The study's findings suggest that gender inequality in intergenerational care is highest in countries with a high level of gendered division of labor, high family obligation norms, and a high level of intergenerational care. Welfare state policies can either reduce or increase gender inequality in intergenerational care by affecting daughters' engagement in caregiving. Therefore, the study's results contribute significantly to SDG 5, which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.

SDG 15: Care Economy
The abstract also touches upon SDG 15, which aims to promote sustainable care economies and support unpaid care and domestic work. The study reveals that in European welfare states, daughters provide most of the care work to elderly parents with functional limitations. Furthermore, the study identifies that parents in need are more likely to receive care from daughters than sons. The study's findings highlight the importance of addressing gender inequality in intergenerational care, as this can lead to the overburdening of women, especially daughters, with unpaid care work. The study's results also suggest that welfare state policies can either reduce or increase gender inequality in intergenerational care by affecting daughters' engagement in caregiving, highlighting the significance of implementing policies that support sustainable care economies and alleviate the burden of unpaid care work on women.

Overall, the abstract's results contribute significantly to both SDG 5 and SDG 15, making it relevant to these SDGs. The study's findings highlight the importance of addressing gender inequality in intergenerational care, which is crucial for achieving gender equality and promoting sustainable care economies. The study's results also suggest that welfare state policies can play a significant role in reducing gender inequality in intergenerational care, underscoring the importance of implementing policies that support sustainable care economies.","

There is substantial comparative and growing experimental evidence that the competition for fertilization among sperm from different males can drive variation in male reproductive investments. However, less is known about the extent of natural variation in these investments relative to environmental variables affecting resource availability and mating system dynamics, which would allow insights into the mechanisms shaping reproductive allocation. Here, we studied interpopulation variation in male investments in testis size and sperm length across 25 populations of the Asian grass frog Fejervarya limnocharis along a 1550-km latitudinal and 1403-m altitudinal transect in China.We found relative testis mass and sperm length, male somatic condition, and the male/female sex ratio to increase with elevation but not latitude or longitude. Our results suggest that environmental variation may underlie local adaptations to reproductive investments among natural populations, mediated by differences in the availability of both resources and sexual partners (including the resulting male–male competition). These findings contrast with previous predictions that increasing latitude and/or elevation should lead to declining reproductive investments in male anurans due to shortening breeding seasons, declining resource availability, and lowering (rather than increasing) male/female sex ratios. We discuss these species differences in the context of differential resource allocation strategies, breeding ecology, and patterns of male–male competition. These differences show the need for future work on reproductive investments in anurans beyond the few model systems and for potential extension of the theoretical framework to species with different mating systems and strategies.",15,"

Linear free energy scaling relationships (LFESRs) and volcano plots are routinely used to assess the performance of heterogeneous electrocatalysts and have only recently been concretely exploited in homogeneous catalysis. These tools efficiently compare and provide a global evaluation of catalyst performance while highlighting the limitations for a given reaction. In the framework of solid-state water oxidation, a minimal overpotential of 0.4 eV has been predicted on the basis of LFESRs. Considering the very different nature of homogeneous catalysts compared to solid-state systems, the validity of scaling relationships determined for the former cannot be assumed. To evaluate the global limitations of molecular O-2 evolution catalysts, LFESRs are established for all key intermediates for different metal (Mn, Co, Ru, Rh, Ir) and ligand (corrole and perfluoro-porphyrin) combinations assuming a mononuclear mechanism that proceeds through *=OH, *=O, and *-OOH intermediates. Our computations indicate that the LFESRs strongly depend on the choice of density functional. Using GMC-QDPT2 as a benchmark, strong scaling relationships between all intermediates are observed, but the relationships between *-OH and *=O significantly differ from those found in solid-state systems. Consequently, the shape of the molecular volcano plot changes drastically from its solid-state counterpart and shows a broad plateau at the top where the overpotential is nearly independent of the choice of catalyst. This plateau renders the performance of molecular catalysts extremely robust, but inhibits improvements by proceeding through alternative reaction mechanisms.",7,"
The provided abstract explores the limitations of molecular water oxidation catalysts using linear free energy scaling relationships (LFESRs) and volcano plots, tools commonly used to evaluate the performance of heterogeneous electrocatalysts. The study considers both Mn, Co, Ru, Rh, and Ir metals and corrole and perfluoro-porphyrin ligands, assuming a mononuclear mechanism involving *=OH, *=O, and *-OOH intermediates. The LFESRs heavily depend on the choice of density functional, and strong scaling relationships are observed between all intermediates with GMC-QDPT2 as a benchmark. However, the scaling relationships between *-OH and *=O differ significantly from those found in solid-state systems. This difference results in a drastically altered volcano plot for molecular catalysts, with a broad plateau at the top where the overpotential is nearly independent of the catalyst choice. This plateau suggests that the performance of molecular catalysts is highly robust, but it also makes it challenging to improve catalyst performance by exploring alternative reaction mechanisms.","

The recent description of potentially generic early warning signals is a promising development that may help conservationists to anticipate a population's collapse prior to its occurrence. So far, the majority of such warning signals documented have been in highly controlled laboratory systems or theoretical models.
 Data from wild populations, however, are typically restricted both temporally and spatially due to limited monitoring resources and intrinsic ecological heterogeneity – limitations that may affect the detectability of generic early warning signals, as they add additional stochasticity to population abundance estimates.

Our paper engages with Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) as an emerging social policy instrument in the Anglo-American world with particular emphasis on the UK.

Second, we question representations of the role of the state as absent, pointing to the disciplining force of calculative devices as a key means allowing government control “at-adistance”. The paper starts with a brief overview of SIBs as a social impact investing tool and a review of the existing scholarly debate on this phenomenon. The following three sections engage with dominant discursive representations that ambiguously position SIBs between “state”, “market” and “philanthropy”, thereby offering a malleable frame that allows interested actors to legitimize the implementation of this policy instrument. This is followed by a discussion of the material side of SIBs: the crucial role of various devices of measurement, evaluation and evidence-production in making SIBs possible.

High occurrence of Fusarium poae (FP) and Fusarium langsethiae (FL) and their mycotoxins nivalenol (NIV) and T‐2/HT‐2 have been observed in Swiss oats. Early prediction of mycotoxin levels is important for farmers and the cereal industry to minimize the risk of contaminated food and feed. Therefore, climate chamber experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of different temperatures (10, 15, 20 °C) and durations (4, 8, 12 h) at 99% relative humidity (RH) on the infection of oats with FP and FL. In addition, to discover the most susceptible period of oats, artificial FL inoculations were conducted at different growth stages. Field experiments were performed to observe the dispersal of these fungal species within the field and to investigate the weather conditions that influence the dispersal. The climate chamber experiments revealed higher contamination with NIV and T‐2/HT‐2 in the 10 °C treatments and with a prolonged humidity duration of 12 h 99% RH. Inoculations of oat plants at early (DC 61) and mid (DC 65) anthesis, led to higher FL infection and T‐2/HT‐2 accumulation in the grains compared with treatments at earlier growth stages, which might be due to an increased susceptibility during anthesis. No indication for spore dispersal was observed in the field experiments. The results obtained, together with the cropping factors that influence infection and mycotoxin production, could be used as a first step in developing forecasting models to predict the contamination of oats with the mycotoxins NIV and T‐2/HT‐2.",2,"

The most prominent responses of Lake Zurich to climate warming include the increase of surface water temperatures, a reduced depth of spring mixing, and the persistent thriving of the harmful cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, a low-light adapted species concentrating in the metalimnion during summer. To study changes of its habitat, we assessed the spatio-temporal metalimnetic boundaries by applying low-pass filtering and binary thresholding to temperature profiles of long-term data (1978–2013, weekly measurements). Due to increasing temperatures over the last 3.5 decades, the onset and duration of metalimnion formation changed significantly (stratification increased by 33 days). Moreover, the upper metalimnetic boundary has undergone a significant drawdown of 2.3 m, accounting for an overall decrease in metalimnion thickness. Being the most abundant species in this zone, P. rubescens was not negatively affected by altered temporal or spatial stratification patterns during its phase of net growth (July–September), as the zone of its optimal light-dependent buoyancy was still located within the metalimnion. The biomass of P. rubescens in August was even significantly related to increasing temperatures. Nevertheless, a further depression of the metalimnetic top boundary may eventually restrict P. rubescens by forcing it into layers of unfavourable light conditions or into the turbulent epilimnetic zone.",14,"

Morphological changes following changes in species' distribution and phenology have been suggested to be the third universal response to global environmental change. Although structural size and body mass result from different genetic, physiological, and ecological mechanisms, they are used interchangeably in studies evaluating population responses to environmental change. Using a 22-year (1991-2013) dataset including 1768 individuals, we investigated the coupled dynamics of size and mass in a hibernating mammal, the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota), in response to local environmental conditions. We (i) quantified temporal trends in both traits, (ii) determined the environmental drivers of trait dynamics, and (iii) identified the life-history processes underlying the observed changes. Both phenotypic traits were followed through life: we focused on the initial trait value (juvenile size and mass) and later-life development (annual change in size [Δsize] and mass [Δmass]). First, we demonstrated contrasting dynamics between size and mass over the study period. Juvenile size and subsequent Δsize showed significant declines, whereas juvenile mass and subsequent Δmass remained constant. As a consequence of smaller size associated with a similar mass, individuals were in better condition in recent years. Second, size and mass showed different sensitivities to environmental variables. Both traits benefited from early access to resources in spring, whereas Δmass, particularly in early life, also responded to summer and winter conditions. Third, the interannual variation in both traits was caused by changes in early life development. Our study supports the importance of considering the differences between size and mass responses to the environment when evaluating the mechanisms underlying population dynamics. The current practice of focusing on only one trait in population modeling can lead to misleading conclusions when evaluating species' resilience to contemporary climate change.",15,"
The abstract explores the differential plasticity of size and mass in response to environmental change in Alpine marmots over a 22-year period. The study finds contrasting dynamics between size and mass, with declining juvenile size and subsequent annual decreases in size, while juvenile mass and annual changes in mass remain stable. The authors suggest that smaller size associated with similar mass indicates individuals are in better condition in recent years.

The authors emphasize the importance of considering the differences between size and mass responses to the environment when evaluating species' resilience to contemporary climate change, as misleading conclusions can result from focusing on only one trait in population modeling.","

This article investigates the new party politics of welfare states with a particular focus on electoral competition. The argument is that welfare state politics are no longer just about more or less, but involve trade‐offs among ‘new’ versus ‘old’ social rights, and hence social investment versus social consumption. However, party priorities on these issues are highly dependent upon their electoral situation. As electoral competition becomes more intense, parties focus more on vote maximisation than on their traditional policy goals. For left parties, this means focusing more on social investment, which appeals to their growing constituency of progressive sociocultural professionals, and less on defending the traditional income maintenance programmes favoured by their core blue‐collar voters. Centre‐right parties, on the other hand, should hesitate to retrench old social rights when electoral competition intensifies because they need to prioritise their appeal to culturally conservative working‐class voters over their traditional fiscally conservative policy profiles. Using a new dataset and a recently published measure of electoral competitiveness, the article shows that as electoral competition intensifies, left governments are willing to prioritise social investment by reducing pension rights generosity in order to expand programmes for new social risks, while centre‐right governments by contrast avoid retrenchment of pension rights and pension expenditures. The findings demonstrate that this relationship is moderated by the presence of a credible radical right challenger, which increases the electoral risk of welfare state recalibration.",17,"

The provided abstract explores the relationship between electoral competition and the prioritization of social protection policies by political parties. The study's core themes include the trade-off between new social rights (social investment) and old social rights (social consumption), as well as the role of party priorities in these issues. This analysis has implications for the following SDGs:

SDG 1 - No Poverty: The study highlights the importance of social investment, which can help reduce poverty by providing support to individuals facing new social risks. Left parties prioritize social investment, recognizing the needs of their growing constituency of progressive sociocultural professionals, while center-right parties need to balance this with the needs of their culturally conservative working-class voters.

SDG 2 - Zero Hunger: This study does not explicitly address SDG 2, but it does touch on food security and access to resources, as social investment can help individuals and communities achieve food security by providing them with the resources and support they need to overcome new social risks.

SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being: The study's focus on new social rights and social investment highlights the importance of addressing emerging health challenges, such as new diseases or health risks associated with climate change. By prioritizing social investment, political parties can help ensure that individuals have access to the resources and support they need to maintain good health and well-being.

SDG 4 - Quality Education: Social investment can also support quality education by providing resources for new educational programs, technology, and other support for individuals facing new social risks. This can help ensure that everyone has access to quality education, regardless of their circumstances.

SDG 5 - Gender Equality: The study touches on gender equality, as it highlights the importance of party priorities in social protection policies. By recognizing the needs of their growing constituency of progressive sociocultural professionals, left parties can help ensure that social protection policies support gender equality and address the unique challenges faced by women and girls.

SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation: This study does not explicitly address SDG 6, but it does touch on access to resources, which is important for achieving clean water and sanitation. Social investment can help individuals and communities access the resources they need to improve water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuring that everyone has access to clean water and sanitation.

SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

The abstract highlights the trade-off between new social rights and old social rights, which can impact inequality. As left parties prioritize social investment and reduce pension rights generosity, they appeal to their growing constituency of progressive sociocultural professionals, who may be more affluent and better educated. This could lead to a narrowing of income and wealth gaps within these communities. However, it could also exacerbate inequality between the left-leaning professionals and the center-right working-class voters who prioritize old social rights. Thus, the study's findings have the potential to inform SDG 10 by shedding light on the complexities of addressing inequality in welfare states.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions

The study's focus on electoral competition and party priorities sheds light on the role of institutions in shaping social welfare policies. The study finds that as electoral competition becomes more intense, parties may prioritize vote maximization over traditional policy goals. This could impact the institutional arrangements that govern welfare states, potentially leading to shifts in policy priorities or retrenchment of old social rights. Understanding the interplay between electoral competition, party priorities, and institutional arrangements could inform SDG 16 by highlighting the importance of strong institutions in promoting social welfare policies that are responsive to changing political dynamics.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals

The study's use of a new dataset and a measure of electoral competitiveness demonstrates the importance of partnerships and collaboration in advancing social welfare policies. By drawing on a wide range of data sources, the study is able to shed light on the complex dynamics of welfare state politics in a more nuanced and comprehensive way. This highlights the importance of partnerships and collaboration in advancing SDG 17 by promoting the use of evidence-based approaches and data-driven insights in shaping social welfare policies.

In conclusion, the study's findings have the potential to inform all three SDGs by shedding light on the complex dynamics of welfare state politics, the role of institutions in shaping policy priorities, and the importance of partnerships and collaboration in advancing social welfare policies.","

Newspapers in both types of countries attributed more responsibility to developed than to developing countries. In line with social identity theory, however, media in developed countries attributed less causal responsibility (blame) to other developed countries than media in emerging economies. The latter countries’ media, in turn, attributed less responsibility to other developing countries than media in developed countries.

This abstract explores the media's portrayal of responsibility for climate change and the associated politics across developed and emerging economies during UN climate summits in 2004, 2009, and 2014. The research investigates how newspapers in Australia, Germany, the United States, Brazil, and India covered the debate surrounding the ""common but differentiated responsibility"" principle, which stipulates that developed and developing countries should mitigate climate change differently due to historical emissions and development needs. The study reveals that newspapers in both types of countries generally attributed more responsibility to developed than to developing countries. However, media in emerging economies attributed less causal responsibility to other developed countries than media in developed countries, in line with social identity theory. Conversely, media in developed countries attributed less responsibility to other developing countries than media in emerging economies. The study also suggests that media in developed countries attributed more responsibility to their own countries than media in emerging economies, although this is consistent with the principle of differentiated responsibility.","
This abstract relates to SDG 13 - Climate Action, as it examines the media's portrayal of responsibility for climate change and associated politics during UN climate summits.

SDG 13: Climate Action

The research presented in this abstract is highly relevant to SDG 13, as it focuses on understanding the media's role in shaping public perceptions of climate change and the associated responsibilities of different countries. The study's findings suggest that newspapers in both developed and emerging economies attribute more responsibility to developed countries than to developing countries, which is consistent with the principle of differentiated responsibility. This principle aims to ensure that developed countries take on a greater share of responsibility for mitigating climate change due to their historical emissions. The study's results also highlight the importance of social identity theory in shaping media coverage, as media in emerging economies attribute less responsibility to other developed countries than media in developed countries. This finding suggests that media in emerging economies may be more aware of the complexities of the global climate change issue and less likely to blame developed countries solely for the problem. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the role of the media in shaping public discourse on climate change and the associated responsibilities of different countries, which is essential for achieving SDG 13.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions

However, when their professional identity as bank employees is rendered salient, a significant proportion of them become dishonest. This effect is specific to bank employees because control experiments with employees from other industries and with students show that they do not become more dishonest when their professional identity or bank-related items are rendered salient.

114,oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:160865,"The politics of double delegation in the European Union
Many international organizations channel financial contributions of their member countries through other international organizations to implement their programs and activities. In this context, the second step of the delegation chain is often costly and—at least seemingly—an easily avoidable duplication of a previous one. We examine the puzzling phenomenon of double delegation in the context of European aid. We argue that governments engage in double delegation in order to strengthen the role of the European Union (EU) as a multilateral donor agency. This leads to an increase in the flow of resources that, at times, exceeds what the Commission can effectively handle alone. Delegating aid to other organizations helps the Commission solve this capacity problem, but it also reduces its control over how the resources are spent. Consequently, the Commission must exercise judgment about which projects it delegates to other international organizations. Our quantitative and qualitative evidence shows that double delegation is more likely where the Commission's capacity as an aid donor is low and where EU members have no strategic interests at stake. We also show that the Commission tries to mitigate the loss of control by earmarking the delegated aid projects more tightly, notably when member preferences are heterogeneous. The results provide a new way of thinking about international delegation and bureaucratic politics in international organizations. Delegation problems may occur even if the interests between the principal and the agent align. Our approach highlights why this happens and how actors try to minimize the costs of this understudied type of agency slippage.",17,"
The abstract explores the concept of double delegation in the context of European aid, which involves channelling financial contributions through other international organizations after they have already been delegated by member countries. The authors argue that governments engage in double delegation to strengthen the role of the European Union (EU) as a multilateral donor agency. This leads to an increase in the flow of resources, but also reduces the EU Commission's control over how the resources are spent. The authors provide evidence that double delegation is more likely where the Commission's capacity as an aid donor is low and where EU members have no strategic interests at stake. The Commission tries to mitigate the loss of control by earmarking the delegated aid projects more tightly, notably when member preferences are heterogeneous.

Although the abstract does not explicitly address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there are some implications impacting SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals. Double delegation in the context of European aid can strengthen the role of the EU as a multilateral donor agency, which aligns with SDG 17's focus on promoting strong partnerships for sustainable development. The study's findings also suggest that governments engage in double delegation to address capacity limitations, which can impact SDG implementation and achievement. The authors note that double delegation increases the flow of resources, which can contribute to achieving SDGs related to poverty eradication (SDG 1), hunger eradication (SDG 2), and sustainable development (SDG 17). However, the study also highlights the loss of control over how resources are spent, which may impact SDG achievement by potentially reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of aid projects. Overall, the study sheds light on the complexities of international delegation and partnerships in achieving sustainable development goals, providing insights that can inform policy and practice in this area.","
SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
The abstract highlights the role of strategic interests in the decision to engage in double delegation. The authors find that double delegation is less likely when EU members have strategic interests at stake. This suggests that countries with greater economic, political, or social power may be more reluctant to delegate aid through the EU Commission, leading to inequalities in the distribution of resources. The study's findings, therefore, have implications for SDG 10, which aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries. Policymakers could consider ways to address the capacity constraints facing the EU Commission to ensure more equitable distribution of resources.

SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions

This highlights the importance of strong institutions in ensuring accountability and transparency in the use of public resources. As such, the study's findings are relevant to SDG 16, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice for all, and strengthen institutions to prevent corruption and promote transparency and accountability. Policymakers could consider ways to enhance the capacity and accountability of international organizations like the EU Commission to prevent corruption and promote transparency in the use of public resources.

SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals
The abstract explores the role of double delegation in strengthening the role of the EU as a multilateral donor agency. The authors argue that governments engage in double delegation to increase the flow of resources and enhance the capacity of international organizations like the EU Commission. This highlights the importance of partnerships and cooperation in achieving sustainable development. Policymakers could consider ways to foster more partnerships and cooperation among international organizations to enhance their capacity and effectiveness in delivering aid and development assistance.

The study of mammals has promoted the development and testing of many ideas in contemporary ecology. Here we address recent developments in foraging and habitat selection, source–sink dynamics, competition (both within and between species), population cycles, predation (including apparent competition), mutualism, and biological invasions. Because mammals are appealing to the public, ecological insight gleaned from the study of mammals has disproportionate potential in educating the public about ecological principles and their application to wise management. Mammals have been central to many computational and statistical developments in recent years, including refinements to traditional approaches and metrics (e.g., capture-recapture) as well as advancements of novel and developing fields (e.g., spatial capture-recapture, occupancy modeling, integrated population models). The study of mammals also poses challenges in terms of fully characterizing dynamics in natural conditions. Ongoing climate change threatens to affect global ecosystems, and mammals provide visible and charismatic subjects for research on local and regional effects of such change as well as predictive modeling of the long-term effects on ecosystem function and stability. Although much remains to be done, the population ecology of mammals continues to be a vibrant and rapidly developing field. We anticipate that the next quarter century will prove as exciting and productive for the study of mammals as has the recent one.

El estudio de los mamíferos ha promovido el desarrollo y puesta a prueba de muchas ideas en ecología contemporánea. En este trabajo, abordamos los nuevos avances sobre la selección de alimentación y de hábitat, dinámica fuente-sumidero, competencia (tanto dentro como entre especies), ciclos poblacionales, depredación (incluyendo competencia aparente), mutualismo e invasiones biológicas. Dado que los mamíferos son particularmente atractivos e interesantes para el público, el conocimiento ecológico resultante del estudio de los mamíferos tiene un alto potencial en educar al público sobre los principios ecológicos y su aplicación al manejo racional. Los mamíferos han sido claves para desarrollar muchos modelos computacionales y estadísticos en los últimos años, incluyendo mejoras a los enfoques y métricas tradicionales (por ejemplo, captura y recaptura) y avances en campos nuevos y en desarrollo (por ejemplo, captura y recaptura espacial, modelos de ocupación, modelos integrados de poblaciones). El estudio de los mamíferos también plantea retos en cuanto a la caracterización exhaustiva de dinámicas en condiciones naturales. El cambio climático amenaza con impactar ecosistemas a nivel mundial, y los mamíferos son sujetos visibles y carismáticos para la investigación de estos impactos, tanto a nivel local como regional y para el modelado predictivo de los efectos a largo plazo sobre la función y estabilidad del ecosistema. Aunque queda mucho por hacer, la ecología poblacional de mamíferos sigue siendo un campo vibrante y de rápido crecimiento. Anticipamos que el próximo cuarto de siglo será tan emocionante y productivo para el estudio de los mamíferos como lo ha sido recientemente.",15,"
